    "Concerns over global warming have led to stricter regulations, pushing oil and gas operators to produce \"green\" oil. One of the primary sources of emissions in the industry is from crude oil storage tanks. When hydrocarbon liquids are transferred into storage tanks from upstream separators, the crude oil is not fully stabilized yet and still contains some dissolved volatile gases, which vaporize inside the tank. These vapors accumulate, increasing pressure within the tank, requiring a pressure relief system to prevent explosions. Such relief mechanism can be either vapor recovery systems with compressors to capture vapors and send them to pipelines for sales, which are more environmentally friendly, or venting to air. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vapor generation within a tank is influenced by two main factors: 1) the pressure drop from the upstream separator to the storage tank, and 2) the tank’s operating temperature. This article focuses on the latter—how the operating temperature of the tank, impacted by seasonal changes, affects emission volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick takeaway for skimmers: <strong>Emission volumes are 22% (Texas) to 56% (North Dakota) higher in summer than in winter</strong> due to increased air temperatures. The summer-winter discrepancy is more pronounced in colder regions because of the greater seasonal temperature difference. See <a href=\"#table-2\" class=\"internal-link\">Table 2</a> below for a simulation summary across various scenarios. Note that this result is specific to the site simulation setups detailed <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#1.1.-Site-(operational)-setups\">below</a> and may need fine tuning for different facility setups. However, the concept should still be generally applicable for most upstream facilities.\n",

    "            <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Flash volume simulation at atmospheric storage tanks using BR&amp;E Promax. The setup assumes a liquid line from a heater operating at 30 psig and 120°F, dumping into an atmospheric tank at a rate of 3028 STBBL/D (34,600 lb/h) year-round. The red line represents vapor emission volumes from the tank. All conditions are held constant over 12 months, except for monthly ambient air temperature to isolate the effect of seasonal temperature on emissions. Williston, North Dakota, seasonal temperatures are used. Results show 47 MCFD emissions during winter and 73 MCFD during summer—a 56% increase.

    "Assume <a href=\"#fig-3\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 3</a> represents a phase envelope of a sample obtained from the liquid line of a separator operating at 200 psig. The blue circle on the figure sits on the 100% liquid bubble point curve, showing that by definition, the liquid is at its bubble point when it leaves any separator. This 200 psig liquid then flows into a heater operating at 50 psig and 120°F, causing the operating condition of the fluid to shift, represented by the red dashed circle. Flash gas is generated from the pressure drop from 200 psig to 50 psig, where 50% of the inlet liquid vaporizes and separates into the gas line of a heater.\n",

    "Now assume the operator increases the heater temperature from 120°F to 150°F. The operating condition of the fluid in the heater shifts horizontally, and now sits on the 5% liquid (95% vapor) curve, shown by the solid red circle. The vapor fraction rises from 50% to 95% due to the temperature increase.\n",

    "This demonstrates why raising temperature leads to higher flash volumes in any vessel, as the fluid’s operating condition moves closer to the 100% vapor dew point curve, increasing the vapor mole fraction.

    "Gas dew point temperatures are critical for compressor applications. In high-pressure setups, like those using reciprocating compressors, accurate dew point calculations help define design parameters for compression chambers and ensure liquid knockout scrubbers are properly sized. For lower-pressure applications (below 300 psig), such as oil-flooded screw compressors, dew point control is essential to prevent liquid condensation during compression, which can lead to lube oil contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific gravity of a mixture affects its dew and bubble points. While the relationship isn’t perfectly linear, heavier mixtures generally exhibit higher dew points at the same pressure than lighter ones. <a href=\"#fig-5\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 5</a> illustrates this effect with vapor samples from the same tank in different seasons. The summer sample, with a higher specific gravity, has a dew point temperature of 222°F at 600 psig, while the lighter winter sample has a dew point of 184°F—a significant difference that could impact operations. \n",

Some of the key inputs used in AP42 can be taken from standard API 12F tank specs such as dimensions (15.5' x 24' for 750 BBL capacity), design pressure (16 oz vent and 1 oz vacuum safety), and tank geometry (fixed roof vertical cylinder).\n",

Standardized capacities range from 90 to 1,000 BBL.</p>\n",
    "    <p><strong>Design Pressure:</strong> Tanks are equipped with a pressure relief mechanism to keep operating pressure below 16 oz (1 psig) to prevent explosion, and a vacuum relief mechanism to stay above 1 oz, preventing implosion.</p>\n",
    "    <p><strong>Compliance and Safety:</strong> For facilities near commercial or residential areas, API guidelines recommend an additional pressure/vacuum relief mechanism for emergency scenarios, set to release at 24 oz for overpressure and 1.5 oz for vacuum. Most remote wellsites in the field do not require this extra installation.</p>\n",
    "    <p><strong>Vent Line Connection Sizing:</strong> The guidelines specify minimum pipe diameters for roof vent lines, especially critical when not venting directly to air. This sizing ensures minimal pressure drop between the vent line and emission control system (e.g., VRU or flare). Typical tank operating pressure is below 0.6 psig, allowing only a small margin to ensure vapor flow to the VRU or flare. Even minor pressure drops from friction can restrict flow, leading to overpressurization and triggering relief valves on the tanks, which results in unwanted emissions. Pipe diameters must be large enough to prevent any pressure drop due to friction that could block flow.</p>\n",

    "        It’s important to clarify that the simulation results for each region are based solely on variations in temperature across different time frames and locations. All other parameters—such as reservoir-specific compositions, pressure, and temperature conditions of vessels—are held constant. In other words, when referencing results for \"Bakken Shale,\" this does not imply that sample compositional data is obtained from Bakken wells. Only the regional temperature data is adjusted. The purpose of keeping all other variables static, aside from temperature, is to isolate and observe the sole impact of seasonal temperature variations across regions. This provides a clearer idea of how much more flash volume can be expected in summer compared to winter at different key regions.\n",

    "                Dew point temperature (which is part of phase envelope) is highly sensitive to composition. The fact that it showed maximum dew point T difference of only 12F (168F vs 190.7F at winter vs. summer) for Bakken in the sim result table should not be assumed to be similar for other similar applications too. For example in <a href=\"#fig-5\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 5</a>, dew point temperature difference at 150 psig is approximately 40 degrees for winter vs summer. However, other parameters are relatively less senstive to composition variations, and can be referenced for general applications.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** When an upstream liquid line flows into a separator vessel, it enters as 100% liquid, with separation occurring inside the vessel. Changing the vessel’s operating temperature or pressure shifts the fluid’s position on a phase envelope, altering its vapor fraction inside a vessel (see <a href=\"#1.1.-Flash-volume-increase\" class=\"internal-link\">1.1. Flash volume increase</a> and <a href=\"#fig-3\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 3</a> above), and compositions of the separated outlet lines. This same phenomenon applies to atmospheric applications like storage tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Increasing a vessel’s temperature raises flash volume, producing a heavier (richer) separated gas with higher energy content and a higher dew point temperature at a given pressure. For the oil line, higher temperature lowers the crude oil’s Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), meaning the crude is more stabilized as more volatiles have separated into the gas line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Emission handling systems (flares or vapor recovery units) should be sized to manage increased gas volume and gravity during summer compared to winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Summer flash volume increases ranged from 20–30% in Texas regions (Eagle Ford, Delaware, Midland) and from 50–60% in North Dakota (Bakken), compared to winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** Colder regions have larger temperature differences between summer and winter, resulting in a greater seasonal variation in tank vapor emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** See <a href=\"#table-2\" class=\"internal-link\">Table 2</a> for a summary of simulation results showing the impact of monthly air temperature on tank vapor emissions by region. "
