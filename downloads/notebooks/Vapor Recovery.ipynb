    "### Example 1. VRT vapor recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "The above discussions on VFD/PID loop (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.1.-VFD-and-PID-Loop\">Section 8.1</a>) and recycle mode (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.2.-Recycle-mode\">Section 8.2</a>) used VRT vapor recovery scenario as an example. VRTs typically require 2-4 psig operating range. Above 4 psig risks a chance of gas blowby to tanks, while below 2 psig risks a chance of liquid overflow to gas line, and into a VRU suction scrubber, triggering high liquid level shutdown on a VRU. This is due to the unique design of a VRT, which I do not cover in detail here.\n",

Assuming 5 psig is the maximum pressure you want on a VRT (5 psig is for liquid level control, VRTs typically have 75-150 psig MAWP rating), there will be a BPV set at 5 psig for overpressure relief to combustor during mechanical failure of a compressor or volume surge (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#note_3\">Note 3</a> for combustor relief working principles). The VRU targets to maintain the VRT pressure between 2-4 psig by ramping up/down a VFD. Gas flows preferentially to the VRU side due to its lower suction pressure (2-4 psig) compared to the flare side BPV's 5 psig resistance, making the VRU the path of least resistance.\n",

Both water and oil tanks typically share a common vent header for vapor recovery or combustion. These headers are usually oversized to minimize friction loss, as the tanks operate at very low pressures (measured in ounces).

These combustors typically require 1-4 oz of inlet pressure to initiate operation (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#note_2\">Notes 2</a>), with capacity increasing at higher inlet pressures - similar to VRUs.

The pallet weights exert backpressure (ex: 14 oz for tank applications) to preferentially drive vapors to the VRU suction line, which maintains lower pressure (ex: 4-13 oz) due to the VRU's vacuum - the higher resistance path through the Enardo/combustor line ensures flow follows this path (VRU suction) of least resistance when the VRU is online. During process upsets or VRU shutdown, the valve relieves excess pressure through either: 1) Vent-to-atmosphere configuration (used in VRT applications as shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-45\">Figure 45</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-46\">46</a> where the VRU inlet is occupied by the VRT gas line), or 2) Pipe-away configuration (for tank vapor recovery systems shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-47\">Figure 47</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-48\">48</a>).

    "### Example 4. Separator drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The term \"drawdown\" refers to artificially reducing wellhead backpressure by lowering salesline pressure. When wellhead pressure decreases, the well responds with increased flowrates. Between wellhead and salesline (150 psig in this example), a primary separator processes the flow: gas moves to salesline while liquids (oil/water) proceed to heaters then atmospheric storage tanks. In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-52\">Figure 52</a>, check valve CHK-6000 acts as a backpressure valve, remaining closed until separator pressure reaches salesline pressure. This accumulated separator pressure creates backpressure that propagates through the wellhead tubing flowline to the downhole BHA and reservoir - higher surface backpressure increases backpressure on downhole reservoir and reduce flowrates.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Installing a compressor between separator and salesline alters this dynamic. The compressor isolates the wellhead from salesline pressure, exposing it only to the compressor's suction pressure (adjustable between 0-50 psig) instead of the full 150 psig salesline pressure plus friction losses. By consuming energy (electricity/fuel gas), the compressor boosts pressure to meet salesline requirements while enabling significant pressure drawdown at the wellhead. During normal operation, all separator gas flows to the compressor suction side (path of the lowest resistance) and the wellhead sees minimal back pressure. During compressor shutdown or volume surge, the separator pressure builds upto the salesline pressure, exerting high backpressure on the wellhead.</p>\n",

    "<li><p><u>Flowing wells:</u> Naturally producing wells where reduced wellhead pressure increases flowrates without requiring artificial lift.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><u>Liquid-loaded wells:</u> Surface pressure reduction decreases the critical gas flowrate needed for downhole liquid removal through the vertical section of a production tubing, eliminating the need for well shutdowns to build-up downhole pressure, or swabbing operations to mechanically unload liquids. Note that these shutdowns or swabbings need to be done a regular basis because the liquids will accumulate again.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><u>Plunger-lift wells:</u> Used both when plunger lift alone is insufficient to remove liquid due to low gas volume <strong>or</strong> for multi-well pads where some wells struggle with liquid loading while others produce adequately. Even for wells producing fine with plungers benefit from reduced bottomhole pressure, responding with production uplift. One compressor can service multiple wells by synchronizing plunger cycles and using compressor auto-start features (triggers upon detecting pressure on a suction line, by a pressure transmitter feedback to the PLC), making this the most cost-effective configuration for multi-well pads.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><u>Replacing gas-lift wells:</u> Separator drawdown offers an alternative for wells lacking pipeline infrastructure for buyback gas or facing expensive buyback sources. When produced gas flowrates are insufficient for gas lift and buyback options are unavailable or costly, drawdown compression can provide a more economical solution. Economic feasibility should be verified beforehand.</p></li>\n",

    "The purpose of casing drawdown is to eliminate gas interference in downhole pumps like sucker rod pumps (SRPs) and electric submersible pumps (ESPs). Gas interference reduces pump efficiency, damages equipment, and forces frequent shutdowns for repairs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional fixes—such as installing downhole separators, optimizing pump placement, or increasing wellhead back pressure—are limited because gas must still travel up the tubing alongside liquids. Casing drawdown addresses the root cause by opening the casing side, creating a dedicated gas relief path.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a wellhead with 150 psig sales line backpressure at the separator. The tubing flowline delivers fluids to the separator for gas/liquid separation, with liquids routed to heater treaters and gas to salesline. As reservoir pressure declines, it can no longer lift liquids up the tubing unaided. An SRP (ESP works too) is installed but suffers from gas interference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>The solution:</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect the casing side to a compressor inlet set at 5 psig suction pressure (adjustable 0-50 psig). The tubing remains at 150 psig salesline backpressure while the casing sees just 5 psig. This 145 psig differential (150-5) drives gas through the casing (the path of least resistance), while liquids are restricted to the tubing because: (1) depleted reservoir pressure lacks energy to push liquids up naturally, and (2) the casing's larger cross-section requires greater lift pressure than the tubing. Recall that there's no pump on the casing side.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Result</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "The wellbore practically functions as a two-phase separator. Gas exits through the casing (to compressor) and liquids through the tubing (via SRP), eliminating gas interference. The compressor suction doesn't pull liquid due to the absence of SRP on the casing side, while the SRP maintains steady liquid production unaffected by gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "While fixing gas interference in downhole pumps is the main purpose of casing drawdown, it also increases gas flow rates. Unlike conventional systems where gas harms pumps, here it flows exclusively up the casing. Reducing casing backpressure from 150 psig to 5 psig typically boosts gas flow rates 2x-6x. This is similar to increasing flowrates by lowering salesline backpressure, explained in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#Example-4.-Separator-drawdown\">Example 4: Separator Drawdown</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uplift is greater for wells intentionally holding higher wellhead backpressure than salesline pressure. This achieves two things: 1) pressure increase shifts the operating point on the phase envelope, reducing bubble-out volume, and 2) compresses gas, decreasing absolute volume and improving pump fillage %. For SRPs, pressures beyond 200 psig show diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume an operator maintains 200 psig wellhead pressure when salesline pressure is 120 psig. Installing casing drawdown creates two distinct pressure regimes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <p class=\"mt-0\">Tubing side: 120 psig salesline backpressure (200-120 = 80 psig artificial backpressure removed)</p>\n",
    "- <p class=\"mt-0\">Casing side: 5 psig compressor suction pressure</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid flowrates increase due to removal of 80 psig artifical backpressure on tubing. Gas flowrate increases on the casing side due to 195 psig (200-5) backpressure reduction, which can easily come back with 4x-6x gas rate increase. \n",

    "<p><strong>Test Separator</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>While casing drawdown keeps most liquids flowing up the tubing, some may flow up the casing due to well slugging behavior. Wells experience frequent pressure and flow rate swings that may temporarily exceed the critical gas flow rate needed to lift liquids up the casing annulus. Entrained liquid in mist form may also travel with gas. A screw compressor's skid-mounted suction scrubber isn't designed as a separator - it only handles small amounts of entrained liquid in gas lines that have already been separated.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"margin-top: 1rem !important;\">The liquid volume may be significant enough to trigger high-level shutdowns in the suction scrubber (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-33\">Figure 33</a>). Predicting liquid flowrate up the casing is difficult as these come from entrained mist or liquid slugs from occasional pressure swings that are difficult to be modeled and predicted. An operator may either try directly hooking up the casing with compressor inlet, and see if a compressor experiences frequent high liquid level shutdowns. If the problem persists, a trailer-mounted test separator, or a small permanent external scrubber may be installed to handle liquids. Or they can just begin with a test separator, observe how the well responds, and then determine whether a permanent scrubber installation is needed.</p>\n",

    "<p><strong>Suction Pressure Setpoint</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>Suction pressure can be lowered to vacuum, but 5 psig is typically recommended. This balances lowering casing pressure while preserving compressor flow rate capacity (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-1\">Table 1</a>). When using an external separator (e.g., trailer-mounted test separator), 5 psig pressure is insufficient to dump liquid to downstream vessels, requiring a liquid pump (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-53\">Figure 53</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-54\">54</a>). If installing a liquid pump is undesirable, operators can maintain 20-30 psig suction. However, the production uplift from maintaining 5 psig suction usually outweighs pump operating costs, as casing-side liquid volumes are typically small.</p>\n",

    "<p><strong>Capacity Sizing</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>Gas flowrate will increase after compression. Size the units for 2-3x current flowrates if above 200 MSCFD, 3x if above 100 MCFD, and up to 4x if under 100 MCFD. Note that these are ballpark numbers based on experience.</p>\n",

    "<p>Casing drawdown applications include:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><p><u>SRP wells:</u> Casing pressure can be set anywhere between 5-50 psig depending on operational needs. The casing pressure is maintained by a skid-contained pressure transmitter PT-5000 on a suction scrubber sending feedback to a control panel PLC-5000 (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-53\">Figure 53</a>). The pressure control mechanisms with PT-PLC feedback are similar to those of <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#Example-3.-Heater-vapor-recovery\">Heater vapor recovery</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#Example-4.-Separator-drawdown\">Separator drawdown</a> applications.</p></li>\n",
    "<li><p><u>ESP wells:</u> ESPs need 70-90 psig on the casing. This is above the 50 psig max suction limit of a compressor, requiring mandatory SCV installation between casing and compressor inlet. A pressure transmitter PT-1000 on the casing sends pressure feedback to control panel PLC-5000 and maintains desired 70-90 psig on the casing (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-54\">Figure 54</a>). The pressure control mechanisms with PT-PLC feedback are similar to those of <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#Example-2.-Tank-vapor-recovery\">Tank vapor recovery</a> in a sense that the PT is directly mounted on the pressure source (casing vs. tank) to control its pressure. The key difference is that while the tank pressure is within the compressor suction limit, but the ESP casing pressure is beyond the compressor suction limit.</p></li>\n",
