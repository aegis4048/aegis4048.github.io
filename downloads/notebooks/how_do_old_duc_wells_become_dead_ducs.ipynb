    "The empirical evidence shows that 95% of the wells in the US are completed within 2 years after drilling. Failing to drill within that time may give birth to what we call the \"Dead\" DUCs - the wells that will never be completed. The speculations as to why those old DUCs are never completed include lost leases and reservoir pressure depletion. However, the study I conducted shows intriguing characteristics that contradict the conventional wisdom that the gap time between drilling and completion has negative impact reservoir conditions, and that it may discourage operators from drilling their old DUCs. In fact, longer gap time seemed to even positively affect production rates for DUC wells under 250~400 days old since drilled."

    "DUC wells are a form of oilfield working capital. They are essentially a long-term, partially funded storage of hydrocarbons \"under\" the ground instead of \"on\" the ground. An operator drills a well but decides to complete it later when its convenient for him for various reasons. For example he contracted rig crews to drill 50 wells, but the oil price suddenly crashed while drilling the 27th well, which makes completing the well and producing from it much less lucrative compared to the high oil price days. Revoking a rig contract can be expensive. He has no choice but to let the rig crews keep drilling through the 50th well. But he does have a choice of when he wants to complete the drilled wells - he chooses to leave the drilled wells uncompleted and plans to frack them when the oil price recovers... but is this really a smart move?\n",
    "\n",
    "<u class='bold'>If a well remains in DUC stage for too long, it no longer functions as a working oilfield capital.</u> Analyst John Freeman from Raymond James & Associates Inc. said that that 95% of the drilled wells have been completed within 2 years, and that DUCs older than 2 years have low chance of ever being completed and considered *out-of-the-system* (a.k.a. *Dead DUCs*). Comparing with the Enverus data of wells in the seven DPR regions supports this claim to be reasonably true (I say \"reasonably\" because the average lag time between completion and drilling varies from basins to basins). \n",

This means that I'm excluding wells that are never completed (I do this because there are many uncompleted wells drilled since 2014 or before that will never be completed. Including these wells will skew the resulting statistics). Visualizing the data for each basin with 95% box plot generates the following figure: \n",

However, the lessee may lose his lease rights if he isn't drilling, producing, or performing any other operations within the 90-day grace period after the first term expiration day. In simple words, <i>\"You can't hold onto your lease unless you are doing something with it\"</i>. \n",

The courts generally consider both an objective standard (i.e., whether the operator was diligent in pursuing completion) and a subjective standard (i.e., whether the operator acted in good faith) to determine if DUC operations extend the primary term.\n",

The EUR vs. lag scatter plot (<a href=\"#fig-4\">Figure 4</a>) shows that the average of each bin remains arguably constant, with some exceptions at the far right due to a lack of data.

    "While the EUR shows <i>\"how much total\"</i> oil and gas can be produced throughout the entire life of a well, the first 12 month production shows <i>\"how fast\"</i> they can be extracted. Usually a high rate (fast) is desirable as it reduces operating costs and extends the lifespan of a well. Each well has an economic limit, beyond which it becomes unprofitable if the cost of operations exceeds the revenue generated from the hydrocarbons produced. High production rate shifts this economic limit to the right on the time axis of a production decline curve, thus extending the life of the well.\n",

    "The first 12-month production is particularly significant for horizontal wells, as they produce a significant portion of their lifetime oil and gas production, accounting for 37% and 25% respectively, in the first 12 months of production (<a href=\"https://nondoc.com/2017/07/12/horizontal-wells-first-three-years/\" target=\"_blank\">source</a>). This is of particular relevance in the current oil and gas industry, where 94% of newly drilled wells are horizontal.\n",

    "\n",
    "The plot of lag vs. EUR (or the first 12 months of production) in our study exhibits intriguing characteristics that contradict conventional wisdom, which assumes that older DUCs have inferior reservoir conditions compared to newly drilled wells. However, our analysis shows that this assumption is only true for wells with lag days exceeding 400. As seen in <a href=\"#fig-6\">Figure 6</a> below, which is a zoomed in version of <a href=\"#fig-4\">Figure 4</a> above, binned by 50 days instead of 100 days, the average EUR for wells in Anadarko and Haynesville increases with the increasing lag days until it reaches 250 lag days, after which it slightly decreases. A closer examination of the other basins in <a href=\"#fig-4\">Figure 4</a> reveals similar trends, with the EUR increasing until 250\\~400 lag days and then gradually decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this study challenge the conventional notion that older DUC wells would exhibit decreased reservoir pressure compared to newly drilled wells. Interestingly, the results indicate the opposite trend for DUC wells with an age less than 400 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons behind this unexpected outcome are not clear. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the impact of increasing lag days on production. It is possible that the wells completed within the 250-400 lag day period possess favorable attributes that contribute to their high production or that improved perforation and production techniques tend to be utilized for those wells. Further research is required to validate these speculations.\n",

    "### 2.3. Reasons for dead DUCs: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical evidence shows that wells older than 2 years have a low likelihood of completion and become dead DUCs. Our analysis of seven DPR regions revealed that 95% of wells in the US are completed within 556 days of drilling, with the probability of completion rapidly declining after that. The speculations as to why those old DUCs are never completed include lost leases and reservoir pressure depletion, in which the latter has been challenged by our study; we found that the decline in EUR and first 12-month production due to increasing time gap between drilling and completion is not substantial enough to discourage operators from completing these wells. In fact, our findings showed that EUR and production actually increase with increasing lag time, up to 250-400 days, which was surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our study suggests that the underlying cause of dead DUCs is not technical problems like reservoir pressure depletion, but logistical issues such as lost leases. Further more, wells completed rougly 1 year after drilling seems to show the best EUR and first year production rates. "
