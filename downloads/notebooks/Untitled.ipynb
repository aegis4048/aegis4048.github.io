    "### Example 2. Tank vapor recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Different pressure control applications (tanks, heaters, separators, wellheads) require different operating pressures. The most challenging is vapor recovery from atmospheric storage tanks at upstream production sites due to their extremely low operating range (measured in ounces). The tank vapor recovery has four notable components: 1) <u>API 12F tank design</u>, 2) <u>Tank vent header</u>, 3) <u>Thief hatch</u> 4) <u>Enardo valve</u> and 5) Combustor.\n",

    "Most tanks in the field are bigger than 250 BBL. This requires 6\" vent header as per API 12F recommendation shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-4\">Table 4</a>. Both water and oil tanks typically share a common vent header for vapor recovery or combustion. These headers are usually oversized to minimize friction loss, as the tanks operate at very low pressures (measured in ounces).  When a VRU fails, a low-pressure combustor must activate to prevent tank overpressurization. These combustors typically require 1-4 oz of inlet pressure to initiate operation (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#note_2\">Notes 2</a>), with capacity increasing at higher inlet pressures - similar to VRUs. To ensure complete combustion of all incoming volumes and prevent PRV/thief hatch activation, the tank vent header must preserve available pressure by minimizing friction loss."

The weights on Enardo essentially functions as a backpressure valve that normally drives gas to VRU side due to VRU suction having lower pressure than Enardo's setpoint, and opens only during pressure surge or VRU failure.

The reason it venting to atmosphere instead of piping to VRU is because the VRT gas line is already taking the VRU inlet.
