    "> **Confidence interval** is uncertainty in summary statistic represented as a range. In the other words, it is a range of values we are fairly sure our true value lies in. For example: I am 95% confident that the population mean falls between 8.76 and 15.88 $\\rightarrow$ (12.32 $\\pm$ 3.56)\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence interval tells you how confident you can be that the results from a poll or survey reflect what you would expect to find if it were possible to survey the entire population. It is difficult to obtain measurement data of an entire data set (*population*) due to limited resource & time. Your best shot is to survey a small fraction (*samples*) of the entire data set, and pray that your sample data represents the population reasonably well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sample data may not be a good representation of a population by numerous factors (Ex: bias), and as a result, uncertainty is always introduced in any estimations derived from sample data. **Due to the uncertainty involved with sample data, any statistical estimation needs to be delivered in a range, not in a point estimate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "How well a sample statistic estimates an underlying population parameter is always an issue (<a href=\"#population_vs_samples\">Population vs. Samples</a>). A confidence interval addresses this issue by providing a range of values, which is likely to contain the population parameter of interest."

    "If you've taken a science class with lab reports in your highschool or college, you probably had to include measurement error in your lab reports. For example, if you were asked to measure the length of a paper clip with a ruler, you have to include $\\pm0.5 \\,\\text{cm}$ or $\\pm0.05\\,\\text{cm}$ (depending on the spacing of tick marks) to account for the measurement error that shows the precision of your measuring tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on <a href=\"#fig1\">figure (1)</a>, the paper clip seems to be about 2.7 cm long, but we don't know for sure because the tickmarks in the ruler is not precise enough to measure decimal length. However, I can tell with 100% confidence that the paper clip has a length between 2 ~ 3 cm, because the clip is between 2cm and 3cm tickmarks. You record the length of the paper clip in a *range*, instead of a *point estimate*, to account for the uncertainty introduced by the limitation of the measuring tool.\n",

Since the population variance $\\sigma^2$ is almost never known, you almost always use t-score for confidence interval. After all, the purpose of using confidence interval is to mitigate the issue of <a href=\"#population_vs_samples\">Population vs. Samples</a> when estimating population parameter ($\\sigma^2$) from samples.

While there exist techniques to check homogeneity of variances (f-test, Barlett's test, Levene's test), it is dangerous to run hypothesis testing for equality of variances to decide which t-test to use (student's t-test or Welch's t-test), because it increases Type I error (asserting something that is absent, false positive).

Health check is applied on two groups, and the measurements are recorded. We say that the measurement from group A is independent from that of group B.<p>\n",

    "Confidence interval of variance is used to estimate the population variance from sample data and quantify the related uncertainty. C.I. of variance is seldom used by itself, but rather used in conjunction with <a href=\"https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/225/\" target=\"_blank\">f-test</a>, which tests equality of variances of different populations. Similar to how the <a href=\"#conf_int_of_diff_in_mean\">confidence interval of difference in mean</a> forms the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/t-test.asp\" target=\"_blank\">t-test</a>, C.I. of variance forms the foundation of f-test. In the field of statistics and machine learning, the equality of variance is an important assumption when choosing which technique to use. For example, when comparing the means of two samples, <a href=\"#4.2.1.-Independent-(unpaired)-samples,-equal-variance---student's-t-interval\">student's t-test</a> should not be used when you have a reason to believe that the two samples have different variances. Personally, I found f-test to be useful for the purpose of reading and understanding scientific papers, as many of the papers I have read use f-test to test their hypothesis, or use a variation of f-test for more advanced techniques. It is a pre-requisite knowledge you need to know to understand the more advanced techniques.\n",

Furthermore, it doesn't always result in successful transformation of non-normal to normal distribution, as discussed <a href=\"#\">below</a>. I recommend to use 2). If you have non-normal samples and your goal is to compute the C.I. of variance, use <a href=\"#\">bootstrap</a>. If your goal is to check the equality of variances of multiple sample data sets with hypothesis testing, use Levene's test.

The process is composed of mainly two parts: random number generator, and for-loop. The random number generator can be parametric, or non-parametric. In case of parametric simulation, you must have some previous knowledge about the population of your interest, such as its shape. In the below code snippet, you assume that the <code>sample</code> is from a specific distribution: <code>normal</code>, <code>lognormal</code>, <code>chisquare</code>.

    "Practitioners wonder <i>WHY</i> bootstrapping works: why is it that resampling the same sample over and over gives good results? If we are resampling from our sample, how is it that we are learning something about the population rather than only about the sample? There seems to be a leap which is somewhat counter-intuitive. The idea comes from the assumption that the sample is a <i>reasonable</i> representation of its underlying population — the population is to the sample as the sample is to the bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to ask question of a population, but you can't because you lack the resources to get measurement data of all possible data points. So you take a fraction of the population, a.k.a the sample, and ask the question of it instead. Now, how confident you should be that the sample answer is close to the population answer depends on how well the sample represents the underlying population. One way you might learn about this is to take samples from different portions of the population again and again. You ask the same question to the multiple samples you collected, and see the variability of the different sample answers to quantify the related uncertainty of your estimation. When this is not possible due to practical limitations, you make some assumptions about the population (ex: population is normally distributed), or use the information in the collected sample to learn about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bootstrapping, you treat the original sample (size=$n$) you randomly acquired from the population as if it's the population itself of size $n$. From the original sample that you treated to be the population, you randomly draw samples, each of size $n$, <i>with replacement</i> multiple times to simulate direct sampling from the original population. By doing so, you essentially imitate sampling different portions of the original population multiple times. This idea is shown in <a href=\"#\">fig (?)</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a <i>reasonable</i> thing to do for two reasons. First, the sample in your had is the best you've got, indeed the only informatoin you have about the population. Second, if the original sample is randomly chosen, it will look like the original population they came from. This means that the sample is a good representation of its underlying population. However, if its not a good representation of the population, bootstrap fails. In fact, there's not much you can do in the first place if your sample is biased. \n",
