    "Many producers, when sizing vapor recovery units (VRUs) or signing long-term contracts for them, tend to overlook an important factor: the inevitable decline of flash gas rates over time. Flash gas rates at heater treaters (HT), vapor recovery towers (VRT), and tanks follow a similar decline pattern to well production, yet it's a common misconception that these rates will remain steady or only decrease marginally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working at a compressor company, I’ve seen firsthand how producers expect flash gas rates to hold relatively flat or marginally decline; the flash gas rates go down much quicker than they think. While the oil decline rate plays the largest role in this reduction, many still fail to account for it when planning for long-term operations. It's not necessarily that they don't know about the decline, but rather that they simply forget to think about it. Downsizing is often not done in a timely manner because it’s overlooked, and as a result, VRUs quickly become oversized and uneconomical. It's also common to see a well experience more than a 50% drop in production within the first few months, making this issue even more critical.\n",

    "## 1. Industry Practices for VRU Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new facility is being built, engineers typically input the expected initial production (IP) flowrates into process simulation software to estimate the expected flash gas flowrates at low-pressure vessels. In the absence of process simulation software, many producers and vendors rely on ballpark estimates using flat scf/bbl numbers based on regional experience to predict flash gas volumes. While quick, this scf/bbl method doesn't account for the operating pressure of the vessels, leading to inaccuracies. These projected rates are then provided to VRU vendors, who size the equipment and provide quotes based on the high IP flowrates. Since these flowrates are often large, the VRU is sized to handle peak capacity, resulting in a costly investment. However, as the well declines, these high flowrates no longer match reality, and the oversized VRU quickly becomes uneconomical. Unfortunately, this issue is often realized too late, as VRUs are not always the primary concern for producers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some keen producers who pay attention to VRUs predict monthly VRU flowrate declines using process simulations or by applying an oil decline curve to the IP flash gas rates. For example, if oil is expected to drop by 50% in the first 4 months and the IP flash gas rate is initially calculated to be 100 MCFD, the flash gas rate will decrease to around 50 MCFD in 4 months (It's important to note that downstream flash gas rates are not significantly impacted by sales gas decline. See section 3.1). The large and expensive compressor sized for peak initial flowrate will either be downsized or moved to a different location with similar production capacity to ensure its continued economic viability."

    "## 5. Conclusion/Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Flash gas rates for VRU applications may decline quickly, quicker than people think. They follow the oil decline curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Many people in the industry tend to forget about the fact that VRU flowrates decline quickly. I've witnessed this first-hand working at a compressor company. Downsizing is often not done in a timely manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Process simulations are performed to show the impact of oil and gas decline on downstream flash gases from low pressure vessels. Simulation site setups are described in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#2.1.-Site-(operational)-setups\">Section 2.1</a>. Well declining rates are simulated with 3 sets of DCA parameters described in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#2.2.-Simulation-scenarios\">Section 2.2</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Simulation results in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-1\">Table 1</a> indicate that flash gas rates at low pressure vessels (heater, VRT) follow oil decline. The primary sales gas has some impact, but negligible compared to oil decline's influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** When forecasting VRU decline, use the decline rate of oil production. Do not predict off the primary produced gas decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** Flash gas rates decline quickly after IP, just like oil. In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-1\">Table 1</a>, flash gas off the heater became halved in 3 months, and quartered in 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7.** Due to fast decline after the initial production, VRU may become quickly uneconomical. In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-4\">Table 4</a> that shows VRU economics for heater, VRU installation on heater flash gas became uneconomical 8 months after IP. Failure to downsize the unit in a timely manner, or being stuck with a long-term contract (unless the unit can be moved to another pad) can be detrimental to lease operating expense (LOE).\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.** Be careful when signing a long-term contract for VRUs. Be prepared to predict VRU economics and move the long-term contracted VRU to new locations on a timely manner to avoid economic loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9.** Energy content coming from low pressure vessel (VRT @3#: 2690 Btu/scf) is higher than the one coming from higher pressure vessel (Heater @50#: 1930 Btu/scf). This is because lighter hydrocarbons like methane and ethane flash off at higher pressures, while heavier hydrocarbons do not flash until the pressure is significantly lower. The difference in energy content has a huge impact on VRU economics. Process simulations are required for accurate prediction of flash gas energy content at different vessels."
