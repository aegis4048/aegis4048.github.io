    "> **Confidence interval** is uncertainty in summary statistic represented as a range. In the other words, it is a range of values we are fairly sure our true value lies in. For example: I am 95% confident that the population mean falls between 8.76 and 15.88 $\\rightarrow$ (12.32 $\\pm$ 3.56)\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence interval tells you how confident you can be that the results from a poll or survey reflect what you would expect to find if it were possible to survey the entire population. It is difficult to obtain measurement data of an entire data set (*population*) due to limited resource & time. Your best shot is to survey a small fraction (*samples*) of the entire data set, and pray that your sample data represents the population reasonably well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sample data may not be a good representation of a population by numerous factors (Ex: bias), and as a result, uncertainty is always introduced in any estimations derived from sample data. **Due to the uncertainty involved with sample data, any statistical estimation needs to be delivered in a range, not in a point estimate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "How well a sample statistic estimates an underlying population parameter is always an issue (<a href=\"#population_vs_samples\">Population vs. Samples</a>). A confidence interval addresses this issue by providing a range of values, which is likely to contain the population parameter of interest within the range of uncertainty."

    "If you've taken a science class with lab reports in your highschool or college, you probably had to include measurement error in your lab reports. For example, if you were asked to measure the length of a paper clip with a ruler, you have to include $\\pm0.5 \\,\\text{cm}$ or $\\pm0.05\\,\\text{cm}$ (depending on the spacing of tick marks) to account for the measurement error that shows the precision of your measuring tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on <a href=\"#fig1\">figure (1)</a>, the paper clip seems to be about 2.7 cm long, but we don't know for sure because the tickmarks in the ruler is not precise enough to measure decimal length. However, I can tell with 100% confidence that the paper clip has a length between 2 ~ 3 cm, because the clip is between the 2 cm and 3 cm tickmarks. You record the length of the paper clip in a *range*, instead of a *point estimate*, to account for the uncertainty introduced by the limitation of the measuring tool.\n",

This boils down to the traditional issue of <a href=\"#population_vs_samples\">Population vs Samples</a>, due to the cost of obtaining measurement data of a large data set. Uncertainty is introduced in your samples, because you don't know if your samples are 100% representative of the population, free of bias.

Since the population variance $\\sigma^2$ is almost never known, you almost always use t-score for confidence interval. After all, the purpose of using confidence interval is to mitigate the issue of <a href=\"#population_vs_samples\">Population vs. Samples</a> when estimating population parameter ($\\sigma^2$) from samples. If you know the population parameters, you probably don't need confidence interval in the first place.</p>\n",

    "Confidence interval of variance is used to estimate the population variance from sample data and quantify the related uncertainty. C.I. of variance is seldom used by itself, but rather used in conjunction with <a href=\"https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/225/\" target=\"_blank\">f-test</a>, which tests equality of variances of different populations. Similar to how the <a href=\"#conf_int_of_diff_in_mean\">confidence interval of difference in mean</a> forms the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/t-test.asp\" target=\"_blank\">t-test</a>, C.I. of variance forms the foundation of f-test. In the field of statistics and machine learning, the equality of variance is an important assumption when choosing which technique to use. For example, when comparing the means of two samples, <a href=\"#4.2.1.-Independent-(unpaired)-samples,-equal-variance---student's-t-interval\">student's t-test</a> should not be used when you have a reason to believe that the two samples have different variances. Personally, I found f-test to be useful for the purpose of reading and understanding scientific papers, as many of the papers I have read use f-test to test their hypothesis, or use a variation of f-test for more advanced techniques. It is a pre-requisite knowledge you need to know to understand the more advanced techniques.\n",

Furthermore, it doesn't always result in successful transformation of non-normal to normal distribution, as discussed <a href=\"#\">below</a>. I recommend to use 2). If you have non-normal samples and your goal is to compute the C.I. of variance, use <a href=\"#\">bootstrap</a>. If your goal is to check the equality of variances of multiple sample data sets with hypothesis testing, use Levene's test.

In case of parametric simulation, you must have some previous knowledge about the population of your interest, such as its shape. In the below code snippet, you assume that the <code>sample</code> is from a specific distribution: <code>normal</code>, <code>lognormal</code>, <code>chisquare</code>.

    "Practitioners wonder <i>WHY</i> bootstrapping works: why is it that resampling the same sample over and over gives good results? If we are resampling from our sample, how is it that we are learning something about the population rather than only about the sample? There seems to be a leap which is somewhat counter-intuitive. The idea comes from the assumption that the sample is a <i>reasonable</i> representation of its underlying population — the population is to the sample as the sample is to the bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to ask question of a population, but you can't because you lack the resources to get measurement data of all possible data points. So you take a fraction of the population, a.k.a the sample, and ask the question of it instead. Now, how confident you should be that the sample answer is close to the population answer depends on how well the sample represents the underlying population. One way you might learn about this is to take samples from different portions of the population again and again. You ask the same question to the multiple samples you collected, and see the variability of the different sample answers to quantify the related uncertainty of your estimation. When this is not possible due to practical limitations, you make some assumptions about the population (ex: population is normally distributed), or use the information in the collected sample to learn about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bootstrapping, you treat the original sample (size=$n$) you randomly acquired from the population as if it's the population itself of size $n$. From the original sample that you treated to be the population, you randomly draw samples, each of size $n$, <i>with replacement</i> multiple times to simulate direct sampling from the original population. By doing so, you essentially imitate sampling different portions of the original population multiple times. This idea is shown in <a href=\"#\">fig (?)</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a <i>reasonable</i> thing to do for two reasons. First, the sample in your had is the best you've got, indeed the only informatoin you have about the population. Second, if the original sample is randomly chosen, it will look like the original population they came from. This means that the sample is a good representation of its underlying population. However, if its not a good representation of the population, bootstrap fails. In fact, there's not much you can do in the first place if your sample is biased. \n",

    "    <p>There's a myth in the field of statistics that bootstrap is a <i>\"cure\"</i> for small sample size. NO, it's not. First, if you have too small sample, by a high chance it is not diverse enough to represent all (reasonably) possible aspects of its population. Therefore, it is not a good representation of its population. Second, small sample size makes its bootstrap C.I. to be narrower than the analytical C.I.. This means that bootstrap C.I. reports small uncertainty even when the sample size is small. Not only this is counter-intuitive, but also it is a violation of the mathematic property of C.I. described by <a href=\"#eq-1\">eq (1)</a>; small sample size $n$ in the denominator of <a href=\"#eq-1\">eq (1)</a> should give wider C.I.. But this is not true with bootstrap C.I. as shown in the below simulation result in <a href=\"#\">fig (?)</a>.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Three things to note in the figure. First, the upper & lower error bars of bootstrap C.I. of means are asymmetric. This is because bootstrap C.I. is not based on $\\pm$ standard error method. This is a very useful property to estimate the <a href=\"#central_tendency\">central tendency</a> of asymmetric (skewed) populations. Second, both bootstrap and analytical C.I. become narrower with the increasing sample size. This intuitively and mathematically makes sense. Third, bootstap C.I. approximates the analyical C.I. very well with large sample size. This is perhaps the most important advantage of using bootstrap. If you have large sample size, you really don't have to worry anything else (except the indepence of samples), and <i>just stick to bootstrap</i>. All the disadvantages of bootstrap will be overcome by the large sample size.</p>\n",
    "    <p>One might wonder what is <i>\"large\"</i> enough in practical applications. Unfortunately, the definition of <i>\"large\"</i> is different for every applications. In the simulation result, it seems that $n = 20$ falls in the category of <i>\"large\"</i> to approximate C.I. of the mean of a normally distributed population with bootstrap. On the other hand, $n=100$ seems to be <i>\"large\"</i> in case of C.I. of the variances of a normally distributed population. The definition of <i>\"large $n$\"</i> can vary with different applications (ex: non-normal data, C.I. of regression coefficient or covariance). Carefully investigate your samples to have a good definition of <i>\"large\"</i>.</p>\n",

Note that bootstrapped 95% or 99% CI are themselves at tails of a distribution, and thus could suffer from such a problem, particularly with small sample sizes.

    "    <p>This assumption raises a few practical issues when dealing with time series. First, by randomly sampling without constraints, naive bootstrap destroys the time-dependence structure in time series. In time series, all data points are aligned with respect to time, but random resampling does not respect their orders. Second, if there's an upward or downward trend in the means or variances, the trend will be lost due to random resampling. Third, because time series is essentially continuous samples of size 1 for each point in time, resampling a sample is equivalent to the original samples; one learns nothing by resampling. Therefore, resampling of a time series requires new ideas, such as block bootstrapping.</p>\n",

Moreover, the range of independent variables ($x$ in single-regession, $x_1, x_2, ... , x_n$ in multi-regression) changes for each bootstrap sample due to randomness. Since the range of the independent variables defines the amount information available, bootstrapping will lose some of the information in the data.

Pareto (infinite variance, infinite mean), t-distribution with <code>df = 2</code> and Cauchy (infinite variance, finite mean) are <i>highly problematic</i> category of distributions. Log-normal distribution has finite variance, so it is theoretically OK, but it can sometimes be heavy tailed enough that the population mean will almost always exceed all of your sample means, which can make inference via a bootstrap tricky.

    "One of the biggest assumptions in the field of statistics is the <b>assumption of normality</b>. It is important because of the two key characteristics of normal distribution: symmetry (low skew) and light/short-tails (low kurtosis). Symmetry is important because many statistical techniques use $\\pm$ standard error methods that assume equal properties from both sides of a distribution. On the other hand, heavy-tailedness is detrimental in inferencing population parameters because heavy tailed distributions (ex: log-normal distribution, cauchy distribution) have non-negligible number of extreme data points that may introduce bias in your samples (understanding the impact of heavy-tailedness is very important in inferencial statistics. Make sure you understand the issues of it by reading <a href=\"#assumption_8\">here</a>).\n",

    "\n",
    "When reporting a summary of a sample data, statisticians tend to report the mean (average) of a sample. But have you wondered why they bother specifically about the means? Often times the ultimate goal is NOT to compute a mean of a distribution, but to compute a <i>measure of central tendency</i> of a distribution. A measure of central tendency is a single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the measure of central tendency that you are the most familiar with, but there are others, such as the median and the mode. However, mean is not a good measure of central tendency when there is a sign of deviation from normality, which can be characterized by skewness (asymmetry) and kutrosis (heavy-tails). "

    "\n",
    "<a href=\"fig???\">Figure (?)</a> below shows the effectiveness of mean, median, and mode as a measure of central tendency for different skewness. For normal distribution (a), most samples are found at the middle, and they are symmetrically distributed around the mean. This makes the mean as a good measure of central tendency. However, in asymmetrical distributions like (b) and (c), the median is a better choice (or arguably the mode) choice of central tendency, as it is closer to the central location of the distribution than the mean does. Naively reporting mean as a summary of data results in misinterpretation of the central location of population. \n",

    "Note that some parametric techniques that assume normality of data are robust to mild skewness. There are many parametric alternatives that account for skewness, such as skewness-adjusted t-test and Box-Cox transformation.

When a distribution has a heavy-tail, it means that the data has extreme data points that can introduce bias to statistical inferences (note that the term <i>bias</i> is defined as the difference between the statistical estimation vs. the actual population parameter). This is because the occurrence of extreme data points are so low that it is unlikely to be included in the sample you collected, and yet there are substantial number of them lurking in the uncollected portion of a population that impacts population parameter due to their extremity. \n",
