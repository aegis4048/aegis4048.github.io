    "> **BEFORE YOU READ:** This post focuses exclusively on the application of oil-flooded screw compressors in the oil and gas industry. It does not cover other compressor types (such as rotary vane, reciprocating, dry screw, etc.) or other applications (like refrigeration, power generation, air compression, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Oil-flooded rotary screw compressors provide a reliable and efficient solution for gas compression across a wide range of applications in the oil and gas industry. These applications include, but are not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote class=\"quote quote2\" style=\"font-family: unset; font-size: unset; font-style: unset; padding-bottom: 12px\"> <div class=\"terminology\" style=\"margin-top: 2px\"><strong>Vapor Recovery:</strong> Capturing vapors from low-pressure vessels like heater treaters, vapor recovery towers (VRT), or atmospheric storage tanks and compressing them into the gas sales line. Without compression, these vapors lack sufficient pressure to enter the sales line and would need to be flared or vented, resulting in both environmental harm and lost revenue from valuable rich gas.</div> <div class=\"terminology\"><strong>Boosting:</strong> Large gas pipelines operate at high pressures (1000–5000 psig), typically handled by multi-stage reciprocating compressors. However, these recips require stable, high suction pressures. Screw compressors excel at stabilizing fluctuating inlet pressures from production wellsites and boosting gas to the required suction pressure for recips, making them ideal for this intermediate role.</div> <div class=\"terminology\"><strong>Wellhead Compression:</strong> Installing a compressor between the wellhead and sales line reduces backpressure on the wellhead, increasing hydrocarbon flow rates. This can also help remove accumulated liquids in shut-in wells, kick-starting production.</div> </blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical rotary screw compressors operate with suction pressures ranging from 0 to 50 psig and discharge pressures up to 350 psig. This post dives into the technical details of oil-flooded screw compressor operations, specifically tailored for operators—whether you're renting or purchasing the unit. Designed for customer operators, this guide provides practical insights into the working mechanism, key vessels and components, P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram), flow control strategies, and common maintenance issues. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of the essential technical knowledge needed to operate screw compressors effectively.\n",

When operating within this range, screw compressors outperform reciprocating compressors for three key reasons: 1) fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance and downtime; 2) lower cost; and 3) better handling of fluctuating inlet pressures. Wellsites, unlike plants, often experience significant pressure swings from the wellhead, which reciprocating compressors struggle to manage.</div>\n",

    "    <div class=\"highlights-title\">3. Lubricating (cooling) oil</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"highlights-content\">The lubricating oil in screw compressors serves three critical purposes. First, it provides a sealing between the two helical rotors (refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#2.1.-Rotors-(male-and-female)\">Section 2.1.</a> for rotor details). This sealing is necessary for compression because the male and female rotors are designed to avoid direct contact. Second, it lubricates the moving parts, reducing friction and wear. Third, it absorbs and dissipates the heat generated during compression. Cooled oil enters the compression chamber, directly contacting the heated and compressed gas. The oil absorbs the heat, exits the chamber, passes through a cooling fan, and re-enters the chamber to continue the cooling cycle. Lubricating oil represents the highest operating cost for screw compressors, as it requires frequent replacement. For a deeper dive into lube oil-related issues, refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#\">Section ???</a>.</div>\n",

    "    <div class=\"highlights-content\">\n",
    "        <p>\n",
    "            Flowrate capacity and horsepower (HP) consumption are influenced by <u><i>(1) suction pressure</i></u>, <u><i>(2) discharge pressure</i></u>, and <u><i>(3) timing gear ratio</i></u>. Typically, discharge pressure cannot be controlled by operators, as it is determined by the sales line pressure. Higher discharge pressures require more horsepower. Increasing suction pressure boosts flowrate capacity but also increases power consumption. While suction pressure cannot be adjusted for atmospheric tanks (as they lack back pressure valves), it can be adjusted for wellheads or vessels like heater treaters, low-pressure separators, or vapor recovery towers (VRTs) using back pressure valves (BPVs). To increase suction pressure and flowrate capacity, raise the BPV setpoint. For vapor recovery on atmospheric tanks or if adjusting the BPV setpoint is not desired, the only alternative is to change the gear ratio by swapping gears (refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#2.3.-Gear-driven-(geared)\">Section 2.3</a> for explanations on gears). Increasing the gear ratio enhances flowrate capacity but also increases HP consumption. <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-1\">Table 1</a> below summarizes the relationships between suction pressure, discharge pressure, gear ratio, flowrate capacity, and HP consumption.\n",
    "        </p>\n",
    "        <p>\n",
    "            Horsepower is another critical factor. Every compressor has a maximum horsepower limit, and operations must stay within this limit. Increasing suction pressure or gear ratios may boost flowrate capacity but can cause the compressor to fail if it exceeds the machine's HP capacity. The scenario highlighted in red in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-2\">Table 2</a> illustrates a compressor running out of HP due to high suction and discharge pressures. In such cases, a larger compressor with a higher HP capacity is required.\n",

    "        <p>\n",
    "            It's important to note that there is no direct correlation between flowrate and horsepower consumption. For example, if a compressor's maximum flowrate capacity is 500 MCFD, increasing the flowrate from 100 MCFD to 300 MCFD will not affect HP consumption as long as it operates within the designed capacity. However, exceeding the design capacity by increasing suction pressure or gear ratio will result in higher HP demand.\n",

    "## 2. Screw compressor (core) working principles\n",
    "\n",
    "> **BEFORE YOU READ:** The term \"compressor\" can refer to two things: a complete compressor package, which includes suction/discharge scrubbers, fans, valves, piping, and the \"core\" compressor, or the \"core\" compressor itself. The \"core\" compressor is the part of the package where actual compression occurs, consisting of two helical rotors inside a compression chamber. This section focuses exclusively on the \"core\" compressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of an oil-flooded screw compressor consists of two helical rotors—a male and a female rotor—enclosed within a compression chamber. The rotors are driven by a shaft, which transfers torque from a driver (either a gas engine or an electric motor) to the rotors. A screw compressor can be either <strong>direct-driven</strong> (non-geared) or <strong>gear-driven</strong>. In a direct-driven configuration, the driving shaft is directly connected to the rotor. In a gear-driven configuration, the driving shaft is connected to timing gears, and the shaft linking the gear to the rotor turns the rotor through the gear. In most screw compressor applications, the driving shaft is connected to the male rotor, but in oil-flooded screw compressors used in the oil and gas industry, the shaft is typically connected to the female rotor or gear. The rotor/gear connected to the shaft (e.g., the female rotor) is the one doing the work, while the other rotor/gear (e.g., the male rotor) spins freely as it is driven by the intermeshing action of the female rotor/gear. As the rotors rotate, gas is drawn into the chamber through the suction port. The intermeshing rotors trap and progressively reduce the volume of the gas as it moves along the length of the rotors toward the discharge port. This reduction in volume increases the gas pressure. The chamber is \"flooded\" with lubricating oil, which serves multiple purposes: it seals the gaps between the rotors, lubricates the moving parts, and absorbs the heat generated during compression. The compressed gas, now mixed with oil, exits the chamber and is separated from the oil in a downstream discharge scrubber before being sent to the pipeline, while the lube oil is recirculated back into the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "A screw compressor features twin helical rotors: one with fewer lobes, called the male rotor, and one with more lobes, called the female rotor. In the upstream oil and gas industry, oil-flooded screw compressors typically use a <strong>4:6 (male:female) female-driven design</strong>. For a non-geared, direct-female driven compressor, this means that for every 1,000 RPM of the female rotor, the male rotor will rotate at 1,500 RPM due to the lobe ratio. The driving rotor (female) receives rotational energy from the driver, while the driven rotor (male) is turned by the intermeshing action of the driving rotor. (Note that this RPM ratio and the driven rotor configuration do not apply to geared units. In geared units, the female \"gear\" drives the male \"gear,\" and the male \"rotor,\" connected to the male gear, turns the female rotor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly manufactured rotors in oil-flooded screw compressors should never experience metal-to-metal contact, as this minimizes wear and ensures longevity.

    "## 3. Choice of a Driver: Electric Motor or Gas Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "A driver that turns the driving shaft can be either an electric motor or a gas engine. There are pros and cons for both, such as noise, weight, energy efficiency, safety, etc. However, the primary motivation to choose one model over the other in the upstream oil and gas industry is company policy on emissions and the presence of power. Note that the fuel gas and electricity consumption is negligible compared to the volume of gas being captured with compressors in the oil and gas industry. The gas engines I've seen consumes about 1~2% of the captured gas as fuel gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Presence of Power</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if an operator strongly prefers electric models over gas engines, this preference does not always guarantee the viability of electric model installation. Some facilities lack access to power, or installing a generator may be too expensive. In such cases, the operator is forced to choose a gas engine model due to the lack of alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Concerns over Emissions</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some companies prioritize minimizing their carbon footprint, while others do not. Those focused on emissions often prefer electric motors, believing electricity is \"cleaner\" than burning natural gas. However, this isn't always true, as 59% of U.S. electricity comes from hydrocarbons (coal and natural gas). Depending on the electricity source, electric motors may not be cleaner than gas engines. For instance, one customer study found gas engines cleaner than electric models due to the lack of \"clean\" electricity source near their facilities."

Larger units, such as Flogistix FX17 or FX20, share a single fan for cooling the discharge gas, lubricating oil, and engine coolant. This design varies depending on the model. The engine coolant is circulated between the engine and the fan to maintain the engine temperature within safe limits. The burned exhaust gas is vented through the top vent line, which is a source of emissions that some companies aim to remove by using electric models. The unit includes an engine oil reserve and an engine oil level maintainer. The maintainer is equipped with an electric switch that sends a shutdown signal to the PLC when the engine oil level is too low. Additionally, though not shown in the photo, the unit is equipped with a solar panel to power the PLC, as the PLC requires electricity.

    "Because the system uses an electric motor-driven liquid pump for liquid discharge, it does not require complex control valves or pneumatic pilot gas lines to operate a pneumatic dump system. It also eliminates the need for an integrated blowcase inside the suction scrubber. Instead, the system uses two additional liquid level switches (positioned below the high liquid level kill switch) to control the pump. In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-15\">Figure 15</a> below, when the liquid level rises above LSH-1000, the switch sends a signal to turn on the pump. The pump operates until the liquid level drops to LSL-1000, at which point it turns off.\n",

    "The key advancement over the previous fully electric model (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#Type-A:-Electric-Driver/Electric-Pump-Dump/Electric-Recycle\">Type A</a>) is the <u>blowcase system</u> - a term derived from its function of using pressurized gas to \"blow away\" accumulated liquid. The  blowcase replaces the electric pump by utilizing the compressor's readily available discharge pressure. When liquid in V-101 exceeds the LS-1010 setpoint, the system automatically initiates a dump cycle, using 30-50# gas from the V-300 discharge scrubber line to push out accumulated liquid. Rather than depending on external power, this design repurposes the compressor's existing energy, reducing maintenance costs and eliminating unnecessary electrical components. By making full use of already available pressure, the system delivers a more cost-effective solution. Refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#6.-Pneumatic-liquid-dump-cycle-(blowcase)\">Section 6</a> for blowcase operation details.\n",

The pneumatically operated valves (CV-1001, CV-1010, and CV-1011) require 20-30 psi of supply gas (either instrument air or gas) to actuate their diaphragms, which is subsequently vented to atmosphere after each operation. While these vent lines could theoretically be connected to a closed disposal system, most field installations vent directly to atmosphere due to the additional piping complexity and cost involved. This venting becomes a continuous source of emissions, representing an environmental tradeoff of the blowcase system's otherwise efficient design. While these gas venting issues can be eliminated by installing an air compressor on site, this adds additional costs for both installation and maintenance of the air compressor, and instrument air line tubings.\n",

In normal operation, XV-1000 blocks pilot gas to CV-1000, keeping it closed.

Unlike the suction scrubber V-100, V-600 doesn't need a blowcase dump system - its position downstream of the compressor provides sufficient pressure for liquid removal, though it still requires a level switch (LS-6000) and dump valve (CV-6000) for automation. \n",

    "## 6. Pneumatic liquid dump cycle (blowcase)\n",
    "\n",
    "The blowcase system solves the limitation of compressor suction scrubbers lacking pressure to dump liquid. These scrubbers separate gas and liquids - gas goes up while liquid falls to the bottom due to gravity. For liquid dumping, suction scrubbers differ from upstream separators because they lack sufficient pressure to dump liquid on their own. While oil-flooded screw compressors have a suction pressure range of 0-50 psig, vapor recovery applications on VRTs (3-5 psig) or atmospheric tanks (0-1 psig) don't reach the minimum 20-30 psig needed for autonomous liquid dumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid from scrubbers is typically dumped to atmospheric storage tanks. The tank's inlet ports are located on its roof. These tanks are usually 20-25 ft tall, requiring the liquid to overcome both the vertical hydrostatic head (10.825 psi for 25 ft tank height × 0.433 psi/ft liquid denstiy) and additional pressure losses through piping and control valves. In practice, operators set dump pressures at 30-50 psig for reliable operation, which explains why upstream heater treaters maintain minimum 20-30 psig. Suction scrubbers usually don't have this much pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-16\">Figure 16</a>, the blowcase (V-101) uses the compressor's discharge pressure (60-350 psig from V-300 discharge scrubber), regulated down to about 50 psig or less (the compressor's maximum suction pressure rating) via a pressure reducing regulator (PR-1000). When the liquid level in V-101 exceeds the level switch LS-1010 setpoint, the system automatically initiates a dump cycle, using this regulated gas pressure to push out accumulated liquid. This \"blow away\" function gives the system its name and provides a solution that uses existing system pressure rather than requiring additional power sources such as eletric liquid pumps. \n",

    "    <p>In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#slideshow-2\">Slideshow 2</a>, when dump cycle is off, liquid continues to flow downward from V-100 to V-101 due to gravity. CV-1001, an equalizing valve, maintains pressure equilibrium between V-100 and V-101. CV-1001 remains open during this phase—it is fail-open, meaning it stays open in the absence of pneumatic supply. The purpose of CV-1001 being open is to ensure the gravitational flow of liquid from V-100 into V-101. Assume the downward-sloping pipe between V-100 and V-101 has a 1-ft height difference between the inlet and outlet. With a liquid density of 0.433 psi/ft in the suction scrubber, a 0.433 psi gravitational hydrostatic head drives the liquid from V-100 into V-101. If some of the liquid in V-101 vaporizes (highly likely due to the volatile nature of the liquids for compressor applications) because of conditional changes, the vapors accumulate and pressurize V-101. While the check valve prevents these volatile vapors from backflowing into V-100, the liquid accumulating in the suction scrubber will be unable to flow downward into V-101 due to the higher pressure vapors of V-101 blocking the other side of the check valve. It is important to note that the absence or failure of CV-1001 can trigger a high-level kill (LSHH-1000) because the liquids in V-100 cannot flow down to V-101.</p>\n",

The pneumatic valves differ from electric types in two primary ways: they lack an electric motor and instead feature a pneumatic supply line. The piston movement mechanism also differs significantly - where electric valves use motor power to directly drive the piston, pneumatic valves rely on supply pressure acting on a diaphragm plate.

    "Another application of solenoid control is in well pad emergency shutdown (ESD) systems. Level gauge sensors monitoring oil/water tanks and pressure transmitters (PTs) installed on separators serve as monitoring devices. When these instruments detect out-of-control conditions, they send emergency signals through electrical wiring to the facility control panel. The system responds by activating a fail-close pneumatically operated shutdown valve (SDV) at the wellhead. This activation occurs when the solenoid interrupts the pneumatic supply pressure that normally keeps the SDV's diaphragm lifted. With the pressure supply cut off, the diaphragm releases and the valve returns to its fail-safe closed position. This automated emergency action prevents hazardous situations including and separator ruptures that could result from overpressure conditions and tank overflows.\n",

    "### 7.4. 3-Way thermostatic valve\n",
    "\n",
    "An oil-flooded screw compressor uses one shared fan for both lube oil and compressed gas. There are two temperature requirements: one for gas pipeline needs (typically 120-140°F, depending on midstream gas gatherers) and another for lube oil injection (200-250°F, per compressor manufacturer specifications). A single fan with fixed blade length, size, and RPM achieves these dual targets through fan tube design differences and 3-way thermostatic valve regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tube bundle configurations differ between the lube oil and gas sections. In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-27\">Figure 27</a>, the upper bundle (lube oil) and lower bundle (gas) have different tube lengths, thicknesses, internal diameters, pass arrangements, and tube counts. However, these fixed physical parameters cannot adapt to changing operating conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the thermostatic valve provides dynamic control. The valve determines real-time mixing ratios between cooled oil (C-port) and hot bypass oil (B-port) to maintain the setpoint temperature at the outlet (A-port). The valve contains an internal wax element that expands or contracts in response to temperature changes, mechanically adjusting the flow split between ports to achieve the desired outlet temperature. Refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#slideshow-4\">Slideshow 4</a> simulations for examples of hot/cold mixing ratio calculations required to maintain the 230°F setpoint at the A-port, while assuming fixed cooler sizing parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-way thermostatic valve installation enables dual-temperature control capability. While the valve automatically adjusts the mixing ratio between cooled oil (C-port) and hot bypass oil (B-port) to maintain lube oil temperature, the PLC separately controls gas discharge temperature. A discharge line thermowell provides temperature feedback to the PLC, which then modulates fan RPM. This allows independent regulation of both systems using one shared fan.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, cooling systems prioritize lube oil temperature control over gas cooling for critical operational reasons. Oil temperature deviations carry severe consequences: excessive heat risks equipment damage, while insufficient heat promotes gas condensation and oil contamination (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#\">Section ???</a>). Given that lube oil replacement represents the largest maintenance cost for these compressors, this prioritization is economically justified. Conversely, aftercooled gas temperature variations have minimal impact since screw compressors process relatively small volumes (e.g., 5% at 180°F) compared to primary separator flows (e.g., 95% at 120°F), making blended temperature effects negligible for the whole salesline temperature requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-way valve primarily serves as secondary cooling control for handling temperature overshoots and flow surges. Its temperature regulation becomes non-functional when incoming oil is already cooler than setpoint (e.g., 230°F) - a frequent occurrence during low-throughput operation. The fundamental issue is thermodynamic: insufficient gas volume means inadequate heat of compression is generated to maintain oil temperature. Without this heat input, the system cannot keep the oil hot regardless of thermostat position. In these low-load conditions (from recycle modes and autostart scenarios, explained in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.2.-Recycle-mode\">Section 8.2</a>), the thermostat defaults to full bypass mode (C-port closed/B-port open), completely circumventing the cooler while providing no heating function. <strong><u>In short, a 3-way themostat is useful only when the incoming oil is hotter than setpoint, and when the cooling fan is adequately sized for heat removal.</u></strong>\n",

The valve's internal wax expansion element automatically adjusts to maintain the A-port outlet temperature at its factory-set point (typically 200-250°F). The wax position determines the mixing ratio between hot bypass oil (entering through B-port) and cooled oil (entering through C-port). Changing the temperature setpoint requires field replacement of the wax element.</p>\n",

    "Unlike pressure or temperature transmitters (typically under <span>&#36;</span>1,000), continuous level transmitters are significantly more expensive (<span>&#36;</span>2,000-<span>&#36;</span>6,000). As a cost-effective alternative, many systems use simple float switches instead of continuous monitoring devices. These switches employ a floating element to detect when liquid levels reach predetermined setpoints, triggering dump valve signals, alarms, or shutdowns without providing constant level data. Continuous monitoring type level gauge transmitters are usually used for storage tanks, while float switches are used for separators and scrubbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid level switches have a floating element that detects liquid level rise and fall inside a vessel. The floating element density is lighter than the liquid. The floating element connects to the bolted body through a thin rod that triggers the switch depending on the position of the floating element. Level switches can be pneumatic type or electric type. When liquid level reaches setpoint levels, the switch connects/disconnects the electric circuit or allows/cuts off pneumatic supply.\n",

    "Liquid level switches operate on identical principles to 3-way solenoid valves (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#7.3.-3-Way-solenoid-valve\">Section 7.3</a>), with one key distinction: instead of receiving electrical signals from a control system, the pneumatic switches are actuated by a floating element that detects liquid levels at a predetermined height. Both devices feature the same three-port configuration (inlet, outlet, vent) and share the same emission issues when vented to atmosphere without a closed capture system and when air compressors are unavailable.\n",

The key difference is that Slideshow 2 splits the pneumatic supply downstream of the level switch into three lines to simultaneously control three valves (CV-1001, CV-1010, and CV-1011), while Slideshow 5 simplifies the demonstration by showing only one pneumatic line for one dump valve.\n",

When liquid exceeds the setpoint (determined by switch installation height), the switch activates and permits pneumatic supply (15-30 psig natural gas or air) to flow. This pressure acts on a diaphragm containing a 10-15 psig spring (set below pneumatic supply operating pressure), forcing it upward to open the dump valve. When level drops, the switch deactivates to cut supply pressure while venting residual pressure through the vent port, allowing the spring to return the diaphragm to its fail-safe closed position.

    "### 7.7. Pressure safety valves\n",
    "\n",
    "Most compressors use spring-loaded pressure safety valves (PSVs) for overpressure protection. As shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-35\">Figure 35</a>, these PSVs feature a 90° angled body design with an outlet diameter larger than the inlet to prevent flow choking. The setpoint pressure is always determined by the MAWP (Maximum Allowable Working Pressure) of the system's weakest component. For example, in a system where the discharge scrubber and flanges are rated for 500 psig but the <a href=\"https://www.leroigas.com/en-us/products\" target=\"_blank\">Leroi HG series</a> compressor has an MAWP of 350 psig, the discharge scrubber PSV would be set at 350 psig to protect the compressor. Following API 520 standards, the PSV begins simmering at the setpoint (350 psig), fully opens at 110% MAWP (385 psig) for normal overpressure scenarios. While 121% MAWP is used for fire case, compressor PSVs aren't sized for fire cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oil-flooded screw compressors require three separate PSVs (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-36\">Figure 36</a>) due to different pressure ratings: one for the discharge scrubber (set at compressor MAWP), one for the suction scrubber, and one for the integrated blowcase which operates at different pressures than the suction scrubber. When activated, PSVs provide rapid, abrupt pressure relief through their 90° upward piping - a critical safety feature demonstrated in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-37\">Figure 37</a>, where lube oil from a discharge scrubber reservoir was propelled to the ceiling during final quality testing at the manufacturing facility. The 90° upward piping prevented potential injury to test loop operators by ensuring the 385 psig (350 psig MAWP + 10% overpressure) discharge was directed vertically rather than horizontally (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-38\">Figure 38</a> shows horizontal pressure relief without the 90° upward piping). This incident occurred during performance test loop operation when system pressure exceeded the PSV's 110% overpressure setpoint. While the PLC typically initiates shutdown at the 350 psig setpoint pressure, the PSV remains the ultimate safety barrier when other controls fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike field separators that may route relief to closed systems or flares, compressor packages from third-party vendors typically vent directly to atmosphere. This design approach stems from operational flexibility requirements: (1) compressors may be installed either before production begins or added later during field development, and (2) they can be removed from service at any time based on production rates and economic factors. These installation and release cycles make dedicated flare headers for compressor PSVs impractical, necessitating atmospheric venting with the standard 90° upward discharge piping for safe operation.\n",

    "### 7.9. Suction control valve\n",
    "\n",
    "A suction control valve (SCV) is a type of a pressure-reducing regulator that maintains outlet pressure at a target setpoint. It is not part of a compressor skid package, but installed outside a skid on the inlet piping into a suction scrubber. It serves two critical purposes: (1) ensuring pressure stays below setpoint to prevent compressor horsepower overload, and (2) maintaining pressure sufficiently close to setpoint to preserve desired flowrate capacity. As shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-1\">Table 1</a> of <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#key4\">Section 1.4</a>, increasing suction pressure boosts flowrate capacity but also increases horsepower demand. The SCV must carefully balance these competing factors - excessive pressure risks high-HP shutdowns, while insufficient pressure reduces capacity and may force gas flaring to relieve excess gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCV maintains pressure through purely mechanical operation of its pressure pilot system (best explained in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#video-2\">Video 2</a> by Kimray, highly recommend you to watch it). The process works as follows: (1) Process pressure acts on the pilot diaphragm through the sensing line, (2) Diaphragm movement physically adjusts a supply gas throttling stem, and (3) This stem modulation controls air flow to the main valve actuator, positioning the valve plug. When the sensing line pressure rises above setpoint, the pilot diaphragm moves to cutoff supply gas, closing the control valve. When pressure drops below setpoint, the diaphragm opens to allow supply gas passthrough, opening the control valve. This mechanical balance continues until stable pressure is achieved. <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-40\">Figure 40</a> shows this system maintaining 30 psig suction pressure on a compressor processing 50 psig heater treater gas, preventing overload shutdowns during pressure surges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SCVs are not installed on tank (below 1 psig) or VRT (1-5 psig) vapor recovery applications because these vessels will never generate sufficient suction pressure to trigger high-HP compressor shutdowns. For separator and heater treater applications, SCVs (costing <span>&#36;</span>1,500-<span>&#36;</span>2,500 per valve package) are only installed when pressure swings could substantially affect compressor operation. They are mandatory for wellhead-proximate applications like casing or primary separator drawdown applications, where 200-300% pressure fluctuations frequently occur. Downstream vessels with stable operation may not require SCVs depending on their pressure characteristics.\n",

Different applications need different operating pressures - for example, a Vapor Recovery Tower (VRT) requires 2-4 psig.

These settings are configured at the skid-mounted control panel."

    "\n",
    "A variable frequency drive (VFD) controls rotational speed for either electric motor or gas engine drivers (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#3.-Choice-of-a-Driver:-Electric-Motor-or-Gas-Engine\">Section 3</a>), adjusting RPM based on electrical signals from the PLC. Pressure transmitters (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#7.8.-Transmitters\">Section 7.8</a>) on the source vessel or suction line continuously transmit data to the PLC. For VRT applications maintaining 2-4 psig with 3 psig target, if pressure reaches 4 psig (indicating built up gas volumes), the PLC commands higher RPM (e.g., 2000 RPM to 2500 RPM) to draw more gas volumes and reduce pressure. Conversely at 2 psig, it reduces RPM (e.g., to 1200 RPM) or activate recycle mode (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.2.-Recycle-mode\">Section 8.2</a>) to allow pressure buildup to 3 psig.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control panel runs a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) loop algorithm that dynamically calculates RPM adjustments. This three-component system: (1) <strong>Proportional</strong> responds to current pressure deviation (instant RPM change), (2) <strong>Integral</strong> addresses persistent offsets (gradual correction), and (3) <strong>Derivative</strong> anticipates trends (prevents overshoot). For a 2-4 psig target at 3.5 psig/1600 RPM, the PID might initially command 2000 RPM to pull down to 3 psig. If this overshoots to 2 psig, the algorithm automatically reduces the next RPM increment and incorporates the error to calculate a more precise adjustment, reaching stable operation within a few correction cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, VFDs with PID control cannot always maintain source pressure within target range, particularly in upstream production applications where wellhead pressures fluctuate significantly. Sudden slug flows can overflood vessels with high instantaneous rates, causing pressure to exceed both target (2-4 psig) and maximum (5 psig) ranges even at maximum compressor RPM. In these cases, excess pressure diverts to flare headers - an environmentally undesirable outcome. Frequent flare activation indicates undersized compressor capacity, necessitating larger unit installation. Conversely, if pressure drops below target range, the PLC activates recycle mode to prevent vessel overdrawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>The PID tuning must be done by a mechanic experienced specifically with oil-flooded screw compressors</u></strong>, including detailed knowledge of the particular model's design characteristics. This specialized tuning typically requires hours to a full day depending on application. The need for model-specific expertise makes rental units more practical than purchases, as most customer operators lack mechanics trained on both: (1) oil-flooded screw compressor technology in general, and (2) the packager's specific model implementation. Many purchased units underperform or experience frequent shutdowns when maintained by personnel unfamiliar with these model-specific knowledge.\n",

The system prioritizes recycle activation over shutdown (set at 1 psig) to maintain continuous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "During recycle mode, two primary actions occur. First, the driver RPM reduces to minimum sustainable levels. Second, the recycle valve opens (either electric type as shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-19\">Figure 19</a> or pneumatic type in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-21\">Figure 21</a>), redirecting discharge gas back to suction. Before reaching suction, the recycle gas passes through a pressure reducing regulator (PR-1000, shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-15\">Figure 15</a>) to prevent high-HP shutdown. See <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-45\">Figure 45</a> for example telemetry data showing driver RPM change with recycle mode activation.\n",

    "<ol class=\"numbered-bullets mt-4\">\n",
    "    <li class=\"mb-2\"><p><strong>Preseving Heat:</strong> Compression generates heat that help maintain unit temperature, preventing potential gas condensation into liquid and lube oil contamination. A complete shutdown typically takes 0.5-3 hours (load-dependent) to regain sufficient operating temperature after restart, during which condensed gas may compromise lube oil quality. <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-57\">Figure 57</a> shows temperature telemetry data in which a unit took 35 minutes to regain temperature from 65°F to 182°F upon restart after a 12-hr shutdown.</p></li>\n",

    "\n",
    "However, prolonged recycle is not desirable for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol class=\"numbered-bullets mt-4\">\n",
    "    <li class=\"mb-2\"><p><strong>Decreased Economic Efficiency:</strong> Recycle mode triggers when there is not enough volume to pull from a source vessel. When the driver \"ramp-up\" setpoint pressure is reached, the rotors will spin at maximum RPM until the pressure drops to the \"slow-down\" setpoint. If the unit is oversized, it may run at full RPM for, say, 2 minutes, then spend 8 minutes idling in recycle mode. During this 8-minute span, energy is wasted (electricity or fuel gas) to keep the unit operating without discharging any gas. This leads to unnecessary resource consumption, both in energy and compressor rental costs. Downsizing to a smaller, more appropriately sized unit can solve this problem. Unfortunately, VRU's are low priority for most operators, and downsizing is almost never done in a timely manner (I wrote an article on this topic: <a href=\"https://aegis4048.github.io/predicting_vru_economics_downsizing_timing_for_declining_wells\" target=\"_blank\">Predicting VRU Economics/Downsizing Timing For Declining Wells</a>).</p></li>\n",
    "    <li class=\"mb-2\"><p><strong>Temperature Control Challenges:</strong>  Electric models face low temperature risks that can lead to lube oil contamination due to insufficient heat generation during recycle mode. Recycle is triggered when the PLC detects low pressure, usually measured at the top of a vessel or on the suction line, indicating low available gas volume. With low volume, there is limited compression occurring, and thus not enough heat is produced to keep the unit hot. In contrast, gas engine models are prone to high temperature shutdowns during recycle. Since the gas engine uses a single driver (the engine itself) to power both the rotors and the fan, a reduction in rotor RPM also lowers fan RPM. Although compression heat drops during recycle, the engine continues to generate significant heat from fuel combustion, which can cause temperatures to rise uncontrollably and trigger a shutdown. These issues are discussed in greater detail in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#9.-Temperature-control\">Section 9</a>.</p></li>\n",

When pressure rises above 5 oz, compressor driver will speed up to pull gas and decrease pressure from the tank. A recycle mode can be set at 4 oz to prevent overdrawing the tank and introduce oxygen ingress.\n",

    "#### 8.3.5. Casing drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of casing drawdown is to eliminate gas interference in tubing side with downhole pumps like sucker rod pumps (SRPs) and electric submersible pumps (ESPs). Gas interference reduces pump efficiency, damages equipment, and forces frequent shutdowns for repairs. Traditional fixes—such as installing downhole separators, optimizing pump placement, or increasing wellhead back pressure—are limited because gas must still travel up the tubing alongside liquids. Casing drawdown addresses the root cause by opening the casing side, creating a dedicated gas relief path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a wellhead with 150 psig sales line backpressure at the separator. The tubing side with the pump sees 150 psig salesline back pressure. Casing side connected to a compressor inlet, sees much lower back pressure (0-50 psig suction pressure). Gas flows to the path of leat resistance - the casing side. The wellhead now functions like a giant two-phase separator, in which gas exits through the casing (to compressor) and liquids through the tubing (via a pump), eliminating gas interference problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While fixing gas interference in downhole pumps is the main purpose of casing drawdown, it also increases gas flow rates. Unlike conventional systems where gas harms pumps, here it flows exclusively up the casing. Reducing casing backpressure from 150 psig to 5 psig typically boosts gas flow rates 2x-6x. This is similar to increasing flowrates by lowering salesline backpressure, explained in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.3.4.-Separator-drawdown\">Section 8.3.4</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "One operational concern for casing drawdown is potential liquid flow up the casing. Normally wells on artificial lift lack pressure to constantly pump liquid on their own, but pressure buildup from liquid accumulation, slug flow, or increased gas flow rate post-compression may occasionally cause gas to exceed critical flow rate (minimum gas flow rate needed to lift liquid). This can make liquids not captured by the tubing-side pump flow up the casing, potentially triggering high liquid level shutdowns on the compressor (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-33\">Figure 33</a>), as the suction scrubber isn't designed as a bulk separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting liquid flow rate up the casing is difficult as these come from entrained mist or liquid slugs from pressure swings that are difficult to be modeled. An operator may start with or without a test separator, observe how the well responds to casing-side liquid, and determine if a permanent external scrubber is needed. These vessels can be simple trailer-mounted test separators with hose connections.\n",

    "\n",
    "Discussion on oil-flooded screw compressor temperature control should be divided into two categories: electric-driven models and gas engine-driven models. The key distinction in temperature management arises from how each model powers the compressor rotors and cooling fan. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Electric</u></strong> (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#9.1.-Electric-models\">Section 9.1</a>) compressors use two motors to independently to drive the compressor rotors and the cooling fan. This arrangement allows precise, real-time RPM adjustments for BOTH components, optimizing temperature control effectively. The cooling fan has 2 sections, for lube oil and and discharge gas (shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-59\">Figure 59</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Gas engine</u></strong> (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#9.2.-Gas-engine-models\">Section 9.2</a>) compressors utilize a single engine to simultaneously power both the compressor rotors and the cooling fan. The rotor RPM becomes the primary control target, eliminating the possibility of dedicated real-time RPM adjustments for cooling. Additionally, gas engines generate significant heat from fuel combustion, which, combined with the heat produced from compression, makes temperature control difficult during hot summer seasons. The cooling fan has 3 sections, for lube oil, discharge gas, and engine coolant (shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-60\">Figure 60</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "These inherent differences result in distinct temperature control characteristics for each compressor type, summarized in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-4\">Table 4</a>. Overall, electric models are better than gas engines at handling temperature control, as long as a unit is not oversized. For electric models, timely downsizing is important as well declines to avoid low temperature and lube oil contamination issues. Oversized units experience frequent recycle, which may not generate enough heat to keep the unit hot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both compressor types, recycle mode (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.2.-Recycle-mode\">Section 8.2</a>) is preferred over complete shutdown when the source vessel lacks sufficient gas to draw from. Recycle maintains compressor operation at minimum sustainable RPM (ex: 900 RPM in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-57\">Figure 57</a>), continuously generating heat from compression to keep the unit warm. In contrast, a full shutdown significantly lowers compressor temperature due to surrounding ambient air cooling, increasing the risk of lube oil contamination from gas condensation at low temperatures (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#10.-Lube-oil-contamination-problems\">Section 10</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-57\">Figure 57</a> shows telemetry data around a 12-hour shutdown. Upon restarting at 12:49 PM, the lube oil temperature was near ambient at 65°F. It took 35 minutes to reach 182°F (by 1:24 PM), then an additional 247 minutes to stabilize at 233°F (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#7.4.-Cooling-fan-/-3-Way-thermostatic-valve\">thermostatic valve</a> setpoint ~230°F, acceptable valve ±3°F tolerance) by 5:31 PM. During this extended warm-up period, gas condensation into liquid likely occurred, mixing with and contaminating the lube oil. Due to these thermal challenges, recycle mode is programmed to activate prior to shutdown to maintain optimal compressor temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A healthy temperature trend for lube oil and discharge gas should look like <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-58\">Figure 58</a>, with the average temperature slightly below the thermostat valve setpoint (e.g., 230°F) and a 5-15°F approach temperature between lube oil and discharge gas. This ensures the gas stays hot enough to prevent lube oil contamination, while also staying below the thermostat setpoint to avoid high temperature shutdown.\n",

    "Electric models offer two real-time temperature control mechanisms: a VFD-controlled fan motor and a 3-way thermostatic valve on the lube oil line. When the fan is properly sized for peak heat loads for the lube oil, the system can manage both lube oil and aftercooled gas temperatures independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where the goal is to maintain 230°F for lube oil on the injection side (pre-compression) and 120°F for gas leaving the compressor skid (post-compression and post-aftercooler). Example P&ID is shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-15\">Figure 15</a>. After compression, the 2-phase mixture of gas and lube oil (purple line) typically experiences a 5-15°F temperature rise, reaching about 240°F (example telemetry data shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-58\">Figure 58</a>). This mixture flows into the discharge scrubber V-300, where gas and oil are separated and directed into different cooler sections (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-59\">Figure 59</a>) sized according to their heat loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary temperature control is assigned to the aftercooled gas. A thermowell installed on the post-aftercooler gas line feeds temperature data to the PLC, which adjusts fan RPM to maintain the 120°F target. Suppose 500 RPM achieves this. Meanwhile, the 3-way thermostat valve manages lube oil temperature by mixing bypassed hot oil with cooled oil to maintain the 230°F setpoint. The valve has an expanding/contract wax element that automatically adjust its position with temperature changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this control strategy assumes that the cooling effect provided by the fan at 500 RPM is also sufficient for the lube oil. If the cooling capacity at this RPM is inadequate, the thermostat valve cannot regulate temperature effectively—even when fully diverting all oil flow through the cooler—leading to high temperature shutdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this constraint, electric-driven units are often prioritized to maintain lube oil temperature over aftercooled gas temperature. This trade-off is reasonable: lube oil temperature control is critical for compressor protection, whereas deviations in aftercooled gas temperature are negligible once the gas mixes into the larger sales pipeline.\n",

    "<strong>Superior Lube Oil Temperature Management</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric models offer superior lube oil temperature management by using a dedicated fan motor that targets lube oil temperature — a more critical parameter than aftercooled gas temperature for compressor operation. This means that the aftercooled gas temperature floats, as shown in (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-63\">Figure 63</a>). Although electric compressors are capable of targeting both aftercooled gas and lube oil temperatures, operations typically prioritize lube oil. The fan-controlled lube oil temperature provides primary regulation, while the 3-way thermostatic valve offers secondary backup control if the fan cannot adequately contain a sudden temperature rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is fundamentally better than gas engine-driven models, which lack independent fan RPM control (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#9.2.-Gas-engine-models\">Section 9.2</a> for gas engine temperature control). In engine models, fan speed is tied directly to rotor RPM, meaning the fan turns at full speed whenever the engine runs at full speed, even if maximum cooling is unnecessary. While the 3-way thermostat helps avoid overcooling by diverting flow around the cooler, the real challenge emerges during recycle mode. Unlike electric units, gas engines continue to produce significant heat from fuel combustion even at low RPM (e.g., 900 RPM during recycle, 2400 RPM full speed), while fan airflow also drops due to the reduced engine speed. Reduced air flow due to reduced RPM means ineffective cooling. This imbalance can lead to overheating during recycle, especially in hot conditions — an issue electric compressors are much better equipped to manage.\n",

A 3-way thermostat valve provides secondary temperature control in case the fan does not respond quickly enough to sudden temperature rises. Because the fan motor targets only lube oil temperature, the aftercooled gas temperature floats. Aftercooled gas temperature was 92°F during the day at 5:00 PM [1], but dropped to 54°F at night around 4:30 AM [2]. This day-night sine wave pattern repeats daily. While configuring the PLC to target aftercooled gas temperature at a setpoint (e.g., 120°F) would create a flat trend on the aftercooled gas line, lube oil temperature management could become more difficult.</p>\n",

    "Overall, electric units are superior to gas engine models for temperature control. However, there is one area where electric models are inferior: when a unit is oversized and experiences frequent recycle mode (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#8.2.-Recycle-mode\">Section 8.2</a>), it cannot generate enough heat of compression to maintain a target temperature (e.g., 215°F on lube oil). While this is not an issue if the unit is properly sized, upstream wells typically decline quickly—often seeing production drop by more than half within 6–12 months. Vapor volumes processed by the compressor decline at a similar rate. For example, in a simulation shown in Table 1 of my <a href=\"https://aegis4048.github.io/predicting_vru_economics_downsizing_timing_for_declining_wells#table-1\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, vapor volumes on a VRT reduced by 86% within 12 months after initial production (IP). Although actual decline rates vary by well, such steep declines are common in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "While timely downsizing would save rental costs and maintain proper compressor operation, it is rarely done on time because VRU downsizing is not the operator's primary focus. As a result, oversized compressors often end up operating in 40–90% recycle mode, failing to generate enough heat to keep the unit hot. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-64\">Figure 64</a> shows an example where an electric compressor failed to maintain the 215°F lube oil target during recycle mode. Over the 16-day span, recycle was active 65% of the time, and the average lube oil temperature was only 191.93°F—well below the desired 215°F. The temperature followed a daily sine wave pattern, peaking around 215°F during the day and dropping to around 170°F at night, reflecting ambient air temperature swings. If the gas system’s dew point temperature is, say, 190°F, this would result in lube oil contamination during the night, as the operating temperature (170°F) falls below the dew point, allowing gas condensation into liquid. This can be fixed by replacing with a smaller unit to decrease, or completely remove, recycle time.\n",

The difference is that this unit had recycle mode active for 65% of the time over the 16-day time span. Recycle mode was unable to generate sufficient heat of compression to keep the unit hot above the 215°F target. The unit recorded a lube oil temperature of 169°F at night around 4:00 AM [1], far below the 215°F target. Overall, the unit averaged 191.93°F lube oil temperature during the 16-day period, still below the desired 215°F. Although the unit occasionally reached temperatures near the 230°F thermostat setpoint, as seen in [2], it mostly stayed around 191.93°F, increasing the risk of lube oil contamination. For this specific unit, discharge pressure was fairly low around 120 psig, which usually don't cause liquid condensation at 191F for most gas compositions.</p>\n",

    "Gas engines burn fuel gas to generate power, spinning the engine crankshaft. This combustion heat becomes an additional source of temperature rise, on top of the heat of compression. As a result, gas engine models are generally free from low temperature issues that can trigger lube oil contamination. However, they face the opposite problem: high temperatures. Unlike electric models, gas engines lack independent RPM control on the fan, meaning the fan speed is tied directly to compressor speed. Combined with the extra heat from combustion—which electric models do not have—this makes temperature management even more difficult for gas engines compared to the electrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Engine-driven models lack a dedicated fan driver because the compressor and fan must share a single engine. Sites using engine models typically have no access to external power, making it impractical to install a separate fan motor. Adding a second engine is also not feasible due to size, cost, and skid space limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine crankshaft extends in both directions. As shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-66\">Figure 66</a>, the left side drives the compressor rotors—either direct-driven (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#2.2.-Direct-driven-(non-geared)\">Section 2.2</a>) or gear-driven (<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#2.3.-Gear-driven-(geared)\">Section 2.3</a>)—while the right side drives the cooling fan through a belt-driven pulley assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pulley assembly works similarly to the timing gears used for compressor rotors. As shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-65\">Figure 65</a>, assume the pulley attached to the engine crankshaft (driver) has a 1-foot diameter, while the fan pulley (driven) has a 2-foot diameter. Based on the pulley ratio, if the engine turns at 1000 RPM, the fan will turn at 500 RPM. The pulley diameter ratio directly sets the fixed speed ratio between the engine shaft and the fan, just as gear ratios determine rotor speed in the compressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, no real-time fan RPM adjustment is possible. When the compressor operates at full speed, the fan does too, potentially causing overcooling. When the compressor slows down, the fan also slows, increasing the risk of undercooling. In practice, undercooling is more common, as the additional heat from fuel combustion overwhelms the fan's maximum cooling capacity, especially during hot summer days. This inability to independently control fan speed is a key reason why electric-driven models offer superior temperature management compared to gas engine models.\n",

    "\n",
    "In electric compressor models, recycle mode often leads to low temperature problems due to limited heat of compression (see <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#9.1.-Electric-models\">Section 9.1</a>). Engine-driven models face the opposite issue: high temperatures during recycle. While the heat of compression is still reduced under low-flow conditions, the heat generated from continuous fuel gas combustion remains significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This becomes particularly problematic because fan RPM is directly tied to compressor RPM. When recycle mode slows the compressor, fan speed also drops, reducing cooling capacity. However, combustion continues producing heat, sometimes overwhelming the cooler’s reduced capacity. Unlike electric models, engine-driven systems must manage both compression and combustion heat sources, making thermal control more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this, the fan must be sized to handle peak heat loads even at minimum operating speeds. For example, if recycle mode maintains compressor speed at 900 RPM and the pulley ratio to the fan is 2:1, the fan operates at 450 RPM. If the maximum compressor RPM is 2400 RPM, the corresponding fan RPM would be 1200 RPM. The cooling system must be capable of removing sufficient thermal load at 450 RPM during recycle, without excessive overcooling at 1200 RPM during full-speed operation. Proper cooling fan sizing by compressor packagers is essential to maintain thermal stability across the full operating range. \n",

    "\n",
    "The 3-way thermostat valve (example shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-27\">Figure 27</a>) is the only available real-time temperature control for engine-driven compressor models. Fan sizing and pulley ratios are fixed at installation and cannot respond to real-time temperature fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-way thermostat valve contains an expanding/contracting element that automatically adjusts its internal mixing position to maintain lube oil temperature near a target setpoint (e.g., 230°F). However, as explained in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#7.4.-3-Way-thermostatic-valve\">Section 7.4</a>, the thermostat valve fails to maintain temperature under two scenarios: [1] if the incoming hot oil bypassing the fan (B-port) is already below 230°F, or [2] if the cooled oil exiting the fan (C-port) remains above 230°F because the cooler cannot remove enough heat. While scenario [1] is rare for engine models due to abundant combustion heat, scenario [2] can occur during hot summer days, especially during recycle mode when fan RPM is reduced and cooling capacity drops. Fan RPM reduces because the fan shares the same engine driver used for compressor rotors, and the PLC prioritizes rotor RPM. This lack of independent fan control is a key reason why electric-driven compressor models offer superior temperature management compared to engine-driven models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the thermostat valve controls only the lube oil temperature. Aftercooled gas temperature is not regulated and floats with ambient conditions. I personally do not have any telemetry data showing aftercooled gas temperature fluctuations for engine models, because temperature transmitters are typically not installed on the aftercooled gas line—there is no purpose in monitoring a parameter that cannot be actively controlled. However, the floating behavior would likely resemble the trend shown in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-63\">Figure 63</a>, with aftercooled gas temperature rising during the day and falling at night, following ambient air temperature cycles.\n",
