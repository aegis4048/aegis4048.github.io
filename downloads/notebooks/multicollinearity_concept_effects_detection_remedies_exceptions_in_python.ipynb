    "> In statistics, **multicollinearity** (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multivariate regression model with collinear predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. - From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>\n",

    "Data scientists love linear regression due to its high model interpretability. Unlike other complex machine learning models (ex: K-nearest neighbor, random forest, or neural net), the interpretation of model parameters is straightforward. Assume a linear regression model defined by  <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$y = 110 x_1 + 50 x_2$</span>. Then, increasing <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_1$</span> by 2 will increase <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$y$</span> by 220, and increasing <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2$</span> by 3 will increase y by 150, controlling the other variable constant. However, it turns out that you can't really <i>\"control\"</i> the other variable under multicollinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Under multicollinearity, the regression coefficients of features change erratically in response to small changes in the sample data. Assume that you trained the following linear regression model with your current data set:\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div id=\"eq-5\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\n",

    "The change was so drastic that the sign of the coefficient for <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2$</span> changed from negative (-) to positive (+). This is unacceptable if you wish to know whether a particular feature negatively or positively affects a response variable by the sign of its coefficient. I show how multicollinearity causes such instability in regression coefficients with sampling through a Python simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the simulation, we fit many multiple linear regression models with 2 features and an intercept. We generate synthetic data set with the procedures described in <i>Section 0. Sample data description</i> <a href=\"#Sample data description\">above</a>, for both low and high multicollinearity populations. We set <code>true_coefs = [13, 0.5]</code> and <code>true_intercept = 2</code>, and add Gaussian noise to the model. For each model, we use <code>n = 100</code> data points to fit coefficients and an intercept. We fit <code>m = 2000</code> different models. This essentially mimicks drawing samples from a population described by the true model   <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$y = 13 x_1 + 0.5 x_2 + 2$</span> with Gaussian noise. This is a type of <a href=\"https://aegis4048.github.io/comprehensive_confidence_intervals_for_python_developers#monte-carlo\" target=\"_blank\">Monte-Carlo method</a>, in which the simulation relies on repeated generation of random numbers to investigate some characteristic of a statistic which is hard to derive analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is shown in <a href=\"#fig-2\">figure (2)</a>. Note that the population with low multicollinearity forms a tight circular cluster of regression coefficiens around the true coefficient values <code>true_coefs = [13, 0.5]</code>, whereas the population with high multicollinearity shows greater variance, represented by its wider elliptical cluster. You can see that the values of coefficient for <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2$</span> ranges between -1.5 to 2. This explains the sign change of the regression coefficient for <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2$</span> between <a href=\"#eq-5\">eq (5)</a> and <a href=\"#eq-6\">eq (6)</a>.\n",

    "(Notes: There is a version conflict between Scipy and Statsmodel. You need Scipy version 1.2 or below or 1.4 or above to use Statsmodel. In my virtual environment, I have <code>statsmodels==0.10.2</code> and <code>scipy==1.4.1</code>)\n",

    "In this section, I demonstrate the the unreliability of linear regression analysis report due to multicollinearity by comparing the analytical solutions of the report, and the actual parameter values obtained with numerical simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout your study of multiple linear regression, you have probably encountered the linear regression analysis report that looks like <a href=\"#fig-4\">figure (4)</a>, which is generated with <a href=\"https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/regression.html\" target=\"_blank\">statsmodels</a> Python library (the figure is generated with the same simulation settings of <a href=\"#fig-3\">figure (3)</a>'s high multicollinearity data). The problem is that multicollinearity makes this report unreliable, especially with the standard errors of the individual regression coefficients. Note that this is not the problem of statsmodels library, but the inherent statistical problem caused by multicollinearity. Problems with standard errors sequentially cause problems with the t-statistic <code>t</code>, p-value <code>P>|t|</code>, and 95% confidence interval <code>[0.025   0.975]</code> of the regression coefficients. This is because standard error is used to compute a confidence interval, and confidence interval is closely related to hypothesis testing, which involves t-statistic and p-value (if you are curious about the relationship between confidence interval and hypothesis testing, check <i>Section 4.2: Confidence interval of difference in mean</i> of my <a href=\"https://aegis4048.github.io/comprehensive_confidence_intervals_for_python_developers#4.2.-Confidence-interval-of-difference-in-mean\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>). Overestimated standard errors sometimes result in failure to reject the null hypothesis on coefficient significance, when it shouldn't be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the overestimated standard errors affect the significance test and confidence intervals of coefficients, but do not affect the coefficients themselves. However, recall that the coefficients are already unstable due to multicollinearity, as explained in <i>Section 3.1: Model instability with sampling</i> <a href=\"#Model instability with sampling\">above</a>. So now you have two sources of pain; not only you can't trust the values of the coefficient themselves, but also their significance test results and confidence intervals. Check <i>Section 4.1: VIF</i> <a href=\"#VIF\">below</a> to understand mathematical relationship between multicollinearity and standard errors.\n",

    "Let's try to understand this with numerical simulations. The idea of using numerical simulations is based on the Law of Large Numbers (LLM): the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times will converge to a single value. That is, we should be able to obtain the true confidence interval of the linear regression coefficients for high multicollinearity data. Recall that this is impossible with analytical solutions reported by linear regression analysis result shown in <a href=\"#fig-4\">figure (4)</a> due to multicollinearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "I generated 100,000 high multicollinearity data sets with the procedures described in <i>Section 0. Sample data description</i> <a href=\"#Sample data description\">above</a>, with five features and an intercept: <code>'true_coefs': [13, 0.5, 5, -1, -24]</code>, and <code>'true_intercept': 2</code>. Then, I trained 100,000 different linear models. In <a href=\"#fig-5\">figure (5)</a>, we observe that the 50th percentiles of the analytical C.I. are always off from the true value, where as those of the numerical C.I. correctly guess the true value. These offsets are consistent with the effects of multicollinearity I discussed in <i>Section 3.1: Model instability with sampling</i> <a href=\"#Model instability with sampling\">above</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to LLM, we know that the C.I. of numerical solution must be true, and that anything not consistent with the numerical C.I. is wrong. In <a href=\"#fig-6\">figure (6)</a>, we observe that the widths of the analytical C.I. are wider than those of the numerical C.I. This is because multicollinearity increases the analytically computed standard errors, which in turn increases the widths of the C.I. But to be fair, the issues with the overestimated standard error is not that big of a deal; it only adds a small problem, on the top of the big problem, which is the actual offset of the coefficients. Furthermore, sometimes the analytical C.I. of high multicollinearity data is narrower than its true confidence interval, which is the case for the feature $X_1$. While it is <i>generally</i> the case that multicollinearity widens the confidence interval, its not always the case.\n",

    "\n",
    "*<u>Structural multicollinearity</u>* occurs when you create synthetic features from the original features. It is a byproduct of the model we specify rather than being present in the data itself. For example, imagine a population modeled by  <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$y = \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_0$</span> with gaussian noise. Let's say that you (a data scientist) don't like the model, and want to add an *<u>interaction term</u>* to increase statistical power of the model. Your new model becomes <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$y = \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_4 x_1^2 + \\beta_5 (x_2 x_3) + \\beta_0$</span>. But there's an obvious problem here. If you add the square of <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_1$</span> to the model, naturally there is a high correlation between <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_1$</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_1^2$</span>. The same idea goes between <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2$</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2x_3$</span>.\n",

    "VIFs can also be computed with linear algebra taking the inverse of a correlation matrix. One problem with this method is that sometimes the data's numerical instability can cause the correlation matrix be not invertible. This is usually the case when the non-diagonal elements of a correlation matrix approximates zero (this means that the data shows no sign of pairwise collinearity) with values like 1.1e-16, -1.2e-17, or 1.3e-16. Such small decimal values cause floating point errors with Python. This problem can be avoided by replacing near-zero values with zero.\n",

    "However, **this is the shortest and simplest way to compute VIFs**, since you don't have to worry about adding a constant term, which is required if you were to compute VIF with statsmodels. However, just like the statsmodels <code>variance_inflation_factor</code>, it does not capture non-linear relationships among feature. This is because the correlation matrix <code>df.corr()</code> captures only pairwise linearity between two features. Note that it assumes Pearson's correlation matrix, according to the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pandas documentation</a>."

    "### 4.2. Correlation matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the remedial procedures for multicollinearity is to drop collinear features, which I discuss in <i>Section 5.1: Elimination</i> <a href=\"#Elimination\">below</a>. This method requires knowing which features are linearly correlated with each other. While VIF checks for the presence of overall multicollinearity among features, it does not tell you which features are linearly correlated. This is where correlation matrix comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlation matrix is a square table of correlation coefficients. Each elements in the table measures a degree of linear relationship between two variables. The values range between -1 ~ 1. A negative value means negative relationship (increasing <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_1$</span> decreases <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_2$</span>), and a positive value means positive relationship (increasing <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_1$</span> increases <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_2$</span>). We usually don't care about the sign of correlation coefficients; we care about the absolute magnitidue of the correlation coefficients. The absolute value of a correlation coefficient close to 1 means strong linearity, and a value close to 0 means random scatter of two features with no linearity. Note that the diagonal elements of a correlation matrix always have a value of 1. This is because we are comparing, for instance, <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_1$</span> against <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_1$</span> itself, which are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check <a href=\"#fig-8\">figure (8)</a> for bivariate scatter plots and their respective correlation coefficient. We see considerable degree of linearity between <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_3 \\leftrightarrow X_5$</span>. If you choose to drop collinear features to remedy the effects of multicollinearty, you may consider dropping one of them, as they show large degree of linearity with each other. But beaware, dropping a feature results in loss of overall prediction power of a model. Make sure that the feature you are dropping does not add much prediction power to a model with feature ranking method, such as permutation feature ranking shown in <a href=\"#fig-7\">figure (?????????????????????)</a>.\n",

In the other words, Kendall's Tau is more precise than Spearman's Rho. However, Kendall's Tau has higher algorithm complexity than Spearman's Rho, which is not a big issue with the 21st century's computing power. Note that Kendall's Tau tends to be smaller than Spearman's Rho."

    "    <p>In general, the purpose of remedial procedures of multicollinearity is to improve the stability of a model. In the other wrods, we want to improve the precision of the true coefficient estimate. While it is true that mean centering reduces the VIF of interaction terms, it turns out that it doesn't reduce the width of the confidence interval of the coefficient estimate for interaction terms, as shown in <a href=\"#fig-14\">figure (14)</a>. The figure tells a lot about mean centering in regards to multicollinearity. </p>\n",
    "    <p><u>First</u>, we observe the changed values of y-intercept and coefficients for features involved with the interaction term (<span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_2$</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_3$</span>). The simulation was run from a population described by the true model <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$y = 15 + 13 x_1 + 0.5 x_2 + 5 x_3 + 9 x_2 x_3$</span> with Gaussian noise. However, the coefficient estimates obtained from mean centering deviates from the true coefficient (<span style=\"color: #ad203e\">red dotted line</span>), because mean centering alters some mathematical properties of the original model, as described <a href=\"#centering_1\">above</a>. While mean centering does not undermine the prediction power of a model, it has an effect of complicating the interpretation of the coefficients. However, if the interpretation of coefficients are not important, it doesn't matter.</p>\n",
    "    <p><u>Second</u>, we see that the coefficient estimates of <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_1$</span> remain unaffected, because it took no part in constructing the interaction term. This confirms again that mean centering is irrelevant unless you add interaction terms into your model.</p>\n",
    "    <p><u>Third</u>, while we observe reduction in VIF for coefficient estimates of <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$X_2X_3$</span> after centering, its confidence interval remains unaffected. This tells us that <b>mean centering does not improve precision of coefficient estimates of interaction terms.</b> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0624-x\" target=\"_blank\">Iacobucci, D., Schneider, M.J., Popovich, D.L. et al. (2016)</a> describes this phenomenon as <i>\"Mean centering helps alleviate “micro” but not “macro” multicollinearity\"</i>. This reduction in VIF, and yet unaffected confidence interval, is the main reason that practitioners often mistakenly think that mean centering helps with multicollinearity, when it doesn't.</p>\n",

Note that it used the same simulation setting used in <a href=\"#fig-14\">Figure (14)</a> above. Three things I want to point out:</p>\n",
    "    <p><u>First</u>, we observe reductions in standard errors <code>std err</code> for independent variables involved with interaction terms (<span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_2$</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$x_3$</span>). This is because VIF, which is directly related to standard errors as shown in <a href=\"#eq-7\">eq (7)</a>, is reduced after mean centering. However, <b>this has no practical advantage because mean centering changes the interpretation of coefficients.</b> Yes, the standard errors are reduced, but compared to what? Comparing the standad errors of coefficients before & after mean centering is like comparing the size of an apple to the size of an orange.</p>\n",
    "    <p><u>Second</u>, the warning message about the <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-by-Condition-Number\" target=\"_blank\">condition number</a> disappeared. This is because mean centering has an effect of improving a matrix's numerical stability.</p>\n",
    "    <p><u>Third</u>, the result of hypothesis testing (<code>t</code> and <code>P>|t|</code>) changes for variables involved with the interaction terms and the intercept (<code>x2</code>, <code>x3</code>, and <code>const</code>). This is because mean centering changes the interpretation of coefficients and y-intercept, as explained <a href=\"#centering_1\">above.</a> After the transformation, instead of testing if <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$\\beta_2$</span> is significantly different from zero, the t-test is now testing if <span style=\"font-size: 90% !important\">$\\beta_2 - \\beta_4 \\bar{x_3}$</span> is significantly different from zero (refer to <a href=\"#eq-10\">eq (10-15)</a>).

    "The significance of a regression coefficient is just a number the software can provide you. It tells you whether it is a good fit or not. If the p<0.05 by definition it is a good one. It does not matter whether it is p<0.00000001 or p<0.01 practically they are the same by definition (although some researchers insist former one is better than the other). If p > 0.05 that means the results can be ditched or you can report it is negative findings.\n",
    "\n",

    "When you run a regression Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + etc, you get an estimate of b1, which is more or less the estimate of the (linear) effect of X1 on Y (holding X2 etc constant).\n",
    "Being an estimate, you cannot be sure that your estimate of b1 is the true value of the effect of X1 on Y.\n",

    "In general, an F-test in regression compares the fits of different linear models. Unlike t-tests that can assess only one regression coefficient at a time, the F-test can assess multiple coefficients simultaneously.\n",

    "The F-test of the overall significance is a specific form of the F-test. It compares a model with no predictors to the model that you specify. A regression model that contains no predictors is also known as an intercept-only model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses for the F-test of the overall significance are as follows:\n",

    "    Null hypothesis: The fit of the intercept-only model and your model are equal.\n",
    "    Alternative hypothesis: The fit of the intercept-only model is significantly reduced compared to your model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Typically, if you don't have any significant P values for the individual coefficients in your model, the overall F-test won't be significant either. However, in a few cases, the tests could yield different results. For example, a significant overall F-test could determine that the coefficients are jointly not all equal to zero while the tests for individual coefficients could determine that all of them are individually equal to zero.\n",

    "2. Key Takeaways\n",
    "    - Multicollinearity occurs when (can be described by ...)\n",
    "    - Multicollinearity makes the values of individual regression coefficients are unreliable\n",
    "        * It can cause change in the signs as well as in the magnitudes from one sample to another sample. If you concluded that feature x1 has a positive impact on a response variable y because the regression coefficient of x1 is positive, this might be wrong. I show this here and here. \n",
    "    - Multicollinearity does not affect the prediction power on a response variable (bundle)\n",
    "    - Use VIF to detect and remove collinear features (if VIF > 10, its problematic)\n",
    "    - Sometimes multicollinearity can be safely ignored (https://statisticalhorizons.com/multicollinearity)\n",
    "    - Multicollinearity among independent variables will result in less reliable statistical inferences.\n",

    "    - Generally occurs when features are highly correlated\n",
    "    - Incorrect dummy variable encoding\n",
    "    - Repetition of the same feature (different units)\n",
    "    - A feature computed from other features is in the data set.\n",

You will have to find a “meaning” for your principal components based on the coordinates of the original variables relative to each component\n",
