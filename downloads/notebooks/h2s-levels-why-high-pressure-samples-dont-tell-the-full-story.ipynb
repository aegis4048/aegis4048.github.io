    "H₂S (hydrogen sulfide) measurement is crucial in process engineering for several reasons: 1) regulatory compliance, 2) personnel safety, and 3) maintaining equipment integrity. Different safety and environmental standards protect both people and the environment, and costs associated with equipment damage vary based on the ppm levels of H₂S, making accurate measurements essential.\n",

    "One problem I've noticed in the energy industry is the assumption that gas sample lab analysis from one pressure point remains representative at other pressure points. For example, operators often take the 20 ppm H₂S value measured from the primary pressurized separator (typically operating between 100–1000 psig), and re-use it for vapor recovery applications, which usually operate at near 0 psig. At this lower pressure, the H₂S ppm can rise to 63 ppm due to phase behavior changes. A model simulating such a facility is shown in <a href=\"#fig-1\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 1</a> below.\n",

However, the gas line (Oil Tank Flash) from the oil tank, operating at 0.4 psig, shows 63.4 ppm H₂S. The H₂S value triples at the lower pressure, demonstrating that reusing the 20 ppm value measured at the HP separator for VRU or combustor applications would be inaccurate.

    "## 2. H₂S measurement practices in upstream Oil and Gas\n",
    "\n",
    "H₂S measurements in upstream production facilities are rarely done using air detection devices. Typically, a gas sample is taken from a primary pressurized separator, usually operating between 100~1000 psig. The main purpose of this sample is to ensure compliance with gas pipeline specifications (such as water content, H₂S, CO₂, and N₂ levels) and to determine the fair price of the gas, with higher energy content leading to higher value. The sample is sent to a lab for compositional analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the operation engineer has concerns about H₂S levels, based on offset well experiences, they may request the lab to specifically report H₂S concentrations at an extra cost. Some labs include this for free, while others charge for it. Often, H₂S is not reported in the standard lab analysis. When asked to provide H₂S ppm numbers, sometime they get a nearby offset well sample analysis that includes H₂S numbers, and report it instead of the actual well they are working on and call it good (which can be, of course, largely inaccurate). <a href=\"#fig-2\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 2</a> shows a real lab sample where H₂S composition is reported, and <a href=\"#fig-3\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 3</a> illustrates a case where H₂S was omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "When H₂S ppm levels are reported by the lab, operators use this information to comply with regulations and meet pipeline and equipment rental specifications. However, issues arise when H₂S ppm values obtained from a pressurized vessel (operating between 100–1000 psig) are applied to atmospheric applications like storage tanks or vapor recovery systems. H₂S concentrations at near-atmospheric pressures can be significantly higher than those measured in high-pressure vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"#fig-1\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 1</a> above illustrates this issue, showing a case where 20 ppm H₂S is reported at a 500 psig separator gas line, but 63.4 ppm and 302 ppm are reported in the gas lines of oil and water storage tanks at 0.4 psig, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "I witnessed a similar issue at a gas compressor rental company. Operators provided H₂S measurements of 10–15 ppm, but our rental equipment suffered damage consistent with much higher concentrations. Initially, our account managers suspected the customer was either lying or mistaken. However, as this problem occurred repeatedly, they asked me to model the facility and simulate H₂S at the compressor inlet. <strong><u>My analysis revealed that H₂S ppm values measured at high-pressure separators are not representative of atmospheric applications.</u></strong> As pressure decreases, lighter hydrocarbons like methane and ethane preferentially flash off more quickly than H₂S, leading to an increase in H₂S concentration as the lighter components escape first.

Light-ends flash off into the gas phase much faster than heavy-ends. By the time the process stream pressure reaches atmospheric level (0 psig), a significant portion of the light-ends has already escaped in the previous separators, leaving behind a higher concentration of heavy-ends.

It’s because the flash point pressure of light-ends is higher than that of heavy-ends. <a href=\"#fig-5\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 5</a> shows the flash point curves of six pure compounds. If the pressure and temperature are to the left of a compound’s curve, it exists as a liquid; if to the right, it exists as vapor.\n",

At the same temperature, propane's (red) flash point pressure is 131 psig, which is lower than ethane. Now, assume these two compounds are in the same system (but exist as independent pure compounds) at the same temperature of 80°F (illustrated by the vertical dashed grey line), and the pressure changes from 620 psig to 300 psig and then 100 psig. At 620 psig, both compounds are in liquid form. As pressure drops to 300 psig, ethane will vaporize while propane remains liquid. When pressure drops further to 100 psig, pressure is below both compounds' flash curves, and both will vaporize. This occurs because ethane's flash point curve is higher than propane's, meaning ethane vaporizes first.\n",

The mixture starts at 1000 psig as 100% liquid. Now, drop the pressure to 300 psig, which is below ethane's flash point but above propane's. Would the mixture be a 2-phase fluid? Yes. However, does this mean the vapor fraction is composed of 100% ethane? No.</p>\n",

It doesn't work like that. Both compounds vaporize together, but the lighter compound preferentially vaporizes more than the heavier one. </p>\n",

    "### 3.2. H₂S ppm level changes in vapor vs liquid\n",
    "\n",
    "H₂S ppm levels are typically more problematic in the gas phase because concentrations are higher there than in the liquid phase. As shown in <a href=\"#fig-6\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 6</a>, H₂S levels in the gas phase are consistently higher than in the liquid phase. Additionally, as the reservoir fluid undergoes separation at decreasing pressures, H₂S ppm in the gas phase rises, while it drops in the liquid phase. This trend holds in both 2-phase and 3-phase separations. Why does this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in H₂S's high flash point pressure of 291 psig. At 80°F and 0 psig, H₂S primarily exists in the gas phase. In simpler terms, H₂S prefers the gas phase, although not as much as lighter gases like methane or ethane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, heavier compounds like pentane, hexane, and heptane, which usually end up in crude oil tanks, have much lower flash points. At 80°F, pentane’s flash point is -4.2 psig, hexane’s is -11.7 psig, and heptane’s is -13.8 psig. At atmospheric pressure (0 psig), these compounds mostly stay in the liquid phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the H₂S ends up in the gas phase because of its lower molecular weight and tendency to remain in gas form as pressure decreases. **As pressure drops, H₂S flashes into the gas phase more easily than it dissolves in the liquid.** Since H₂S has lower solubility in the liquid phase compared to heavier hydrocarbons, it concentrates in the gas phase as pressure decreases, while its presence in the liquid phase lessens."

The simulation shows two key results: 1) H₂S levels are higher in the gas phase than in the liquid phase, and 2) H₂S concentrations increase in the gas phase as separation progresses, while they decrease in the liquid phase. This phenomenon is due to H₂S's high flash point pressure and its preference to flash into the gas phase rather than dissolve into the liquid phase.</p></div>"

This scenario was assuming 1000 BOPD, 500 BWPD, 5 MMSCFD production. How would the ppm values change at different production rates? I provide Promax sim result screenshots in this section for readers to observe and learn. For all scenarios, oil prod is fixed at 1000 BOPD. Water rate ranges between 100 to 2000 BWPD, and gas rate ranges from 2 MMSCFD to 20 MMSCFD. Oil gravity is assumed to be 40° API (impact of API gravity didn't seem to be much after running some simulations)."

For oil tank flash gas, H₂S levels were 2.5 times higher than in the separator gas, whereas for water tank flash gas, the difference was 13–24 times greater. Stricter standards should be applied for water tank flash lines.\n",

However, high GOR results in only ~10% higher H₂S ppm compared to low GOR, and the effect of GOR on H₂S ppm is minimized in high watercut applications.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** H₂S ppm levels are important to comply with regulations, prevent equipment damage, and ensure personnel safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** H₂S ppm levels measured in high-pressure applications should not be applied to low-pressure environments, as the compositions change during separation at lower pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** H₂S ppm levels significantly increase at low pressure. For example, in <a href=\"#fig-1\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 1</a>, 20 ppm measured at the 500# separator rises to 63.4 ppm and 302 ppm at the atmospheric oil and water tank flash lines, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** H₂S levels increase as lighter ends (methane and ethane) flash off before (and more) H₂S enters the gas phase. This occurs because methane (MW=16.04) and ethane (MW=30.07) are lighter than H₂S (MW=34.08), giving them higher flash point pressures, as shown in <a href=\"#fig-5\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 5</a>. However, methane is the main driver, as it flashes significantly easier than ethane (shown in <a href=\"#fig-4\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#table-1\" class=\"internal-link\">Table 1</a>), leaving a higher concentration of H₂S in lower-pressure vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** H₂S levels are much higher in gas streams than in liquid streams because H₂S has a high flash point pressure of 291 psig (at 80°F) and prefers the gas phase. As pressure drops, H₂S flashes into the gas phase more readily than it dissolves into the liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** Discrepancies between high- and low-pressure ppm levels are more pronounced in water tank flash gas than in oil tank flash gas. For oil tank flash gas, H₂S levels were 2.5 times higher than in the 500 psig separator gas, whereas for water tank flash gas, the difference was 13–24 times greater (shown in <a href=\"#table-3\" class=\"internal-link\">Table 3</a>). Stricter safety and corrosion standards should be applied for water tank flash lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7.** The impact of GOR and water cut is minimal. The main factor is the compositional changes due to pressure drop and flashing.\n"
