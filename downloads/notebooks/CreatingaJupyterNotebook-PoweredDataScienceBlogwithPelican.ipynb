Pelican-powered blogs are light and easy to host with no scaling concerns. It pre-generates HTML files and responds with the existing files during a typical HTTP request-response cycle.\n",

    "<code>output</code> directory is the folder where Pelican stores the auto-generated HTML files, and those existing files are returned to the user who sent an HTTP request to view your website.

    "\n",
    "Let's say that you are developing a web-app with Django, and you want part of your website to be a static blog. You have a Pelican-generated output HTML file called <code>article_1.html</code>. In Django, you can render your Pelican-generated HTML file using a basic Class-Based-View like this:\n",

    "And that's all it takes to integrate Pelican with Django. Part of your website can be static pages where it doesn't need to execute any code on a server, but the other part of your website can be dynamic pages where you can send queries to your server. Of course, the methodology to combine Pelican with dynamic backend will differ for each backend framework of your choice, but you get the idea.\n",
