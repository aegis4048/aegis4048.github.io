    "<code>output</code> directory is the folder where Pelican stores the auto-generated HTML files, and those existing files are returned to the user who sent an HTTP request to view your website.

    "Let's say that you are developing a web-app with Django, and you want part of your website to be a static blog. You have a Pelican-generated output HTML file called <code>article_1.html</code>.

Of course, the methodology to combine Pelican with dynamic backend will differ for each backend framework of your choice, but you get the idea.\n",
