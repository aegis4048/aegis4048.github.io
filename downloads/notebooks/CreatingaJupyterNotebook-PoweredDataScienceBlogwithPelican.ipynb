    "[Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) is a static site genertor, written in Python. It is a Python library used to auto-generate HTML elements that are used to run websites. Pelican-powered blogs are light and easy to host with no scaling concerns. All it's doing is pre-generating HTML files and responding with the existing files during a typical HTTP request-response cycle. \n",

    "<code>output</code> directory is the folder where Pelican stores the auto-generated HTML files, and those existing files are returned to the user who sent an HTTP request to view your website. The other directories are tools and templates used to generate the HTML files in the <code>output</code> folder. You do not need to configure a SQL database, or execute any codes on the server. However, it does not mean that you cannot have backend features on your website. You can pre-generate the output HTML files, and just wrap it around with the backend engine of your choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you are developing a web-app with Django, and you want part of your website to be a static blog. You have a Pelican-generated output HTML file called <code>python_article.html</code>. In Django, you can render your Pelican-generated HTML file using a basic Class-Based-View like this:\n",

Part of your website can be static pages where it doesn't need to execute any code on a server, but the other part of your website can be dynamic pages where you can send queries to your server. Of course, the methodology to combine Pelican with dynamic backend will differ for each backend framework of your choice, but you get the idea.\n",

Every articles you see in [archives](https://aegis4048.github.io/archives.html) page is rendered using Jupyter Notebook .ipynb files. Even this very article you are reading right now!\n",
