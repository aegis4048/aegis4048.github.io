# aegis4048.github.io

For those who are interested in replicating or learning from my blog - 

You can freely copy any contents from my blog (I don't care), but it seems that there's a misunderstanding of what this repo is. This repo is an output repo of a source repo that generates this.

So if you want to learn creating a blog similar to mine, what you should be looking at is this repo: https://github.com/aegis4048/aegis4048.github.io-source

Based on the number of stars this repo has (13) vs. the stars the source repo has (2), it's seems apparent that there's a room for misunderstanding. 

If you are interested in just learning HTML, CSS, Javascript interactions, maybe this repo does the job for you, but if you are interested in actually "generating" a static site, you need to look at the source repo which uses a static site generator "Pelican"
